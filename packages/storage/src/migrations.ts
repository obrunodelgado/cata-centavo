 * `core/description.ts` leaves every cached row carrying the old value. The
 * rebuild policy is the re-derive pass, and this number is what triggers it.
 *
 * Under `rebuild`, `apply` replays every entry from 0 against a dropped file,
 * so a future `{to: 2}` is an additional statement rather than an `ALTER` — a
 * `CREATE TABLE transactions` in both entries would fail on the second.

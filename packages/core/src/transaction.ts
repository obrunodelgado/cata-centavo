/**
 * A transaction as we speak of it, which is not as Pluggy speaks of it (ADR §14.0).
 *
 * Two fields carry corrections that cost real money if reversed, both recorded
 * in `docs/plans/2026-07-26-phase-2-transactions-design.md`:
 *
 * - `amountCents` is normalized: negative is money out on every account type.
 * - `currency` is the account's currency, the unit `amountCents` is denominated
 *   in, never the purchase's original currency.
 *
 * The detail fields are extracted at map time rather than kept as raw Pluggy
 * blobs, so SQL can use them in later derivation rules and the MCP boundary can
 * expose our vocabulary.

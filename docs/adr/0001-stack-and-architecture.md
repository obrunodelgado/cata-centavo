# ADR 0001 — Stack, architecture and distribution

Date: 2026-07-25
Status: **accepted in its foundations, open in its scope.**

The engineering decisions (§3–§11) are settled and evidence-backed. The categorization scope (§12) and the roadmap ordering (§15) still carry blocking questions: §13 lists two open decisions, §12.12 four more, §14.3 one, and "Branches not yet walked" five — two of which block Phase 0 and Phase 1. **Do not read this document as ready to execute end to end.** Phases 0 and 0.5 are safe to start; everything from Phase 2 onward depends on questions this ADR names but does not answer.

**Amendment, 2026-07-25 — Phase 0 unblocked, by deletion rather than by decision.** Configuration is now read from environment variables and nothing else. There is no config file, so the format-versioning question that blocked this phase has no subject left. Three further decisions fall out of that one: §9's credential sealing is suspended, §2's append-only registry cannot exist, and `init` validates without writing anything. Each affected section carries its own note below: §2, §4, §9, §14.6, §15 Phase 0, and "Branches not yet walked".

**Amendment, 2026-07-26 — `manualUpdate` moves to Phase 0, because its debounce turns out to belong to Pluggy.** `init` now asks every configured connection to sync, unconditionally, and waits for it. The reason it can happen this early is that the "debounce measured in hours" of §11 needs no local state: `PATCH /items/{id}` answers **409 `CLIENT_IS_UPDATING_BEFORE_ALLOWED_FREQUENCY`** when the last sync is too recent, naming both the enforced interval and that sync's timestamp. Read the refusal as a successful *already fresh* and the whole feature needs no table, which is what unblocked it from Phase 5. Affected: §4, §11, §14.5, §14.6, §15 Phase 0 and Phase 5, §16.1, §16.2. `docs/research/pluggy-item-update.md` carries the sources and, more usefully, what the docs contradict themselves about.

> **Amendment, 2026-07-26 — `manualUpdate` is removed, and the amendment above is superseded.** Connector 200 refuses `PATCH /items/{id}` unconditionally, with a bare 400 (`MeuPluggy item cant be updated`) that carries no `codeDescription` and is documented on no page Pluggy publishes. Connector 200 is the only connector this project supports, so the refresh could never have succeeded for any user. Commit `7c63f20` deleted `core/refresh.ts`, `cli/progress.ts`, `Bank.refreshConnection`, `UPDATE_RATE_LIMIT` and the second rate-limit window; `init` is read-only again. Every section the amendment above named — §11, §14.5, §14.6, §15 Phase 0, §15 Phase 5, §16.1 and §16.2 — carries its own superseding note, and §14.7's inventory drops to sixteen tools. Two things built alongside it survive, because the read path needs them: Pluggy's error envelope is parsed on every non-2xx, and the 429 backoff honours `Retry-After`. Evidence: `docs/research/pluggy-item-update.md`, §"Connector 200 refuses to be updated at all".

> **Amendment, 2026-07-26 — Phase 0.5 was run against real accounts, and four of this document's premises did not survive it.** `docs/research/2026-07-26-phase-0-5-recon.md` is the capture: one wallet, three connections on connector 200, six accounts, 1751 transactions, 26 bills, 130 categories, read-only, every figure recomputed from raw response bodies rather than taken from a summary. It is one wallet, and where a finding rests on a sample of two or three it says so. Four findings change what gets built. **`GET /transactions` is gone** — 410 `ENDPOINT_DEPRECATED` on all six accounts, replaced by `GET /v2/transactions` with cursor pagination, which takes §14.2's pagination rule with it. **Enrichment is arriving** — `category` on 99.7% of rows — which makes §12 dormant rather than dead (§12.1). **The sign convention inverts between `BANK` and `CREDIT`**, so a mixed `SUM(amount)` partially cancels instead of merely meaning nothing (§14.1). **The open-bill signal is settled**, and neither §14.3 nor the prior implementation had it right (§14.3). Affected: §12.1, §12.2, §12.3, §12.4, §12.12, §14.1, §14.2, §14.3, §15 Phase 0.5 and Phase 3, and "Branches not yet walked".
>
> **Scope now lives in `docs/prd.md`.** What we are building, in what order, and what "done" means for each phase is that document's job as of 2026-07-26; this one keeps the engineering decisions and still wins on every engineering question. Where the two disagree about *scope*, the PRD is newer. §15's roadmap and the PRD's phase list have to be read together, and a change to one that does not reach the other is a bug in the pair.

## Context

`cata-centavo` is an MCP server that exposes Brazilian Open Finance data to an agent, reading from Pluggy via Connector 200 / MeuPluggy.

Talking directly to the Open Finance Brasil APIs requires membership in the BACEN Participant Directory: an ITP license, ICP-Brasil/OFB certificates, mTLS, FAPI, DCR per institution, and certification against the OpenID Foundation conformance suite. The barrier is regulatory, not technical. No open source alternative exists as a *data source* — only as a layer on top. Pluggy is therefore a premise, not a choice.

Product detail (tools, per-institution pitfalls, rate limits) lives in the main spec. This ADR records the engineering decisions.

---

## 1. Audience and distribution

**Decision:** a product for technically-minded friends, and a portfolio piece. Published publicly on npm, run via `npx cata-centavo`. The package name was verified as available on the registry.

**Alternatives rejected:**

| Alternative | Why not |
|---|---|
| Strictly personal use | Doesn't justify publishing; `npm i -g github:...` would do |
| Portfolio only (code to read, not run) | Throws away half the value; we want people using it |

**Accepted consequences:**

- The README is a first-class deliverable, not a footnote.
- Onboarding has to work for a third party, which requires `init` and `doctor` (§4).
- Publishing publicly means strangers' issues in the inbox.

---

## 2. Item discovery is impossible

**Verified fact** in `pluggy-sdk@0.90.0`: `Item` is the only resource in the SDK without a list operation.

```
fetchAccount / fetchAccounts        singular + plural
fetchInvestment / fetchInvestments  singular + plural
fetchConsent / fetchConsents        singular + plural
fetchCreditCardBill / ...Bills      singular + plural
fetchItem                           singular ONLY — fetchItems does not exist
```

This is not an oversight. It is a deliberate security decision by Pluggy, who ask integrators to track `itemId`s in their own datastore. A leaked API key cannot enumerate connections.

**What this does and does not mean.** The earlier version of this ADR concluded "the `itemId` necessarily comes from the user, pasted by hand, and there is no way to improve on this". That is too strong. Reviewing the prior Go implementation (§16) surfaced two mechanisms this document had missed:

**`POST /connect_token`.** Pluggy issues a short-lived token (30m) that opens the Pluggy Connect widget. Passing an existing `itemId` re-authenticates that connection — this is the supported recovery path when credentials expire or consent is revoked, and it means **re-linking never requires the user to find a UUID again**. Omitting the `itemId` creates a *new* item through the widget. The Go implementation always passes one, using it purely for re-auth.

**An append-only local registry.** Rather than a hand-maintained list, the server records every `itemId` the first time any tool resolves it successfully. Once seen, never lost. The prior implementation's own comment states the reasoning independently: *"The Pluggy API has no 'list all items' endpoint, so the server remembers each item_id the first time any tool resolves it successfully."* — corroborating §2's finding from a second direction.

> **Amendment, 2026-07-25 — the registry does not exist.** Under environment-only configuration there is no file of ours to append to, so nothing is remembered between runs. The set of connections is exactly what `PLUGGY_ITEM_IDS` says at process start. This is a real loss and not an implementation detail: the paragraph above was the reason onboarding could be described as "paste each id once, ever", and without the registry it is "keep each id in your environment". Bring the registry back the day a local file exists again, wherever that file lands.

**What remains genuinely impossible on our tier:** capturing the id of a *newly created* item back into a local process. The widget hands the new `itemId` to a callback, and callbacks mean webhooks, which the free tier does not include (see Context). So first contact with a bank still requires the user to read an id from the MeuPluggy dashboard and give it to us once. After that, the registry and connect tokens carry it.

**Consequence:** onboarding is "paste each id once, ever" — not "maintain a list of ids". The remaining job is to trade *silent failure* for *verified failure* at that one moment — see §4.

**Bonus findings that resolve pitfalls from the main spec:**

- `fetchConsents(itemId)` returns a `Consent` carrying explicit `expiresAt` and `revokedAt`. Revoked consent stops being guesswork: an empty response plus a revoked consent becomes an explicit tool error instead of "you had no transactions this month".
- `Item` exposes `status`, `executionStatus`, `statusDetail`, `lastUpdatedAt` and `consecutiveFailedLoginAttempts` — raw material for `doctor` and `listSources`.

---

## 3. Runtime and language

**Decision:** Node 24 (`.nvmrc` = `v24.15.0`), TypeScript executed via native type stripping. No build step in development, no `tsx`, no `ts-node`.

> **Amendment, 2026-07-27 — the published floor drops to Node 22.13; the development floor stays 24.** `engines` now reads `>=22.13.0`. Nothing above changes: `.nvmrc` remains `v24.15.0`, because type stripping is what buys the no-build-step development loop, and 22.13 has none of it — a `.ts` test file there dies with `ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION`, and a whole-suite run reports `# tests 0` and exits 0, which is the silent green this file already warns about. The published package needs far less: it ships compiled `.js`, so its only hard requirement is `node:sqlite` unflagged. Measured by compiling `src` and `tests` to JavaScript and running the suite on each runtime (531 tests; the `tools/` set excluded because it reads repo-relative paths and fails everywhere off-root) — Node 20.13.1 and 22.5.0 cannot import `node:sqlite` at all, while **22.13.0, 22.20.0 and 24.15.0 each pass 531/531, identically**. The floor between 22.5.0 and 22.13.0 was not bisected; 22.13.0 is the lowest version tested, not the lowest that works. The `ExperimentalWarning` Node 22 prints for `node:sqlite` goes to stderr, so §4's stdout rule survives untouched. Node 20 stays unreachable, since it would take a native SQLite binding and §10 rules that out. CI gains a `[22, 24]` matrix and a job pinned to 22.13.0 that builds and runs the CLI — the floor is a promise `engines` makes to strangers, and no other job in the pipeline can test it.

Verified on Node 24.15.0 with TypeScript 7.0.2:

| Scenario | Result |
|---|---|
| `node file.ts`, no flags | works |
| `import { x } from "./mod.ts"` | works |
| `node --test` on `.ts` files | works, including native `t.mock.timers` |
| `enum`, `constructor(private x)` | `ERR_UNSUPPORTED_TYPESCRIPT_SYNTAX` |
| `const x: number = "string"` | **runs fine** — Node strips types, it does not check them |

That last row is the one that matters: **type checking is neither optional nor a runtime concern.** `tsc --noEmit` remains mandatory, in the role of a linter.

```jsonc
// tsconfig.json — the options carrying weight
{
  "module": "nodenext",
  "erasableSyntaxOnly": true,             // rejects enum / parameter properties at tsc time,
                                          // before they become a production crash
  "verbatimModuleSyntax": true,
  "allowImportingTsExtensions": true,     // source imports "./balance.ts"
  "rewriteRelativeImportExtensions": true // build emits "./balance.js"
}
```

The `allowImportingTsExtensions` + `rewriteRelativeImportExtensions` pair closes the loop: import `.ts` (what Node wants in dev), publish `.js` (what the package needs). Verified against the generated `dist`.

**Accepted consequence:** no `enum` and no parameter properties. See §13 — open.

---

## 4. A CLI that is also an MCP server

**Decision:** the binary is a CLI with subcommands; the MCP server is the default mode.

```
npx cata-centavo init      interactive: validates credentials, validates each itemId,
                           prints "✓ Nubank — last synced 3h ago", writes config
npx cata-centavo doctor    diagnostics: consent, item status, last sync
npx cata-centavo           no argument = MCP server over stdio
```

**Rationale:** an MCP server on stdio **cannot prompt interactively** — stdin/stdout are the JSON-RPC channel, and any `readline` there corrupts the protocol. So `init` cannot be a tool; it has to be a CLI mode.

Argument parsing via `node:util` `parseArgs`, no dependency.

**Accepted consequence:** an interactive flow, config file writing, and a versioned config format enter scope. None of this was in the original implementation plan — it becomes step 0 (`init`) and step 7 (`doctor`).

> **Amendment, 2026-07-25.** Only the last sentence survives. Configuration comes from `PLUGGY_CLIENT_ID`, `PLUGGY_CLIENT_SECRET` and `PLUGGY_ITEM_IDS` (comma-separated), so there is no interactive flow, no file to write and no format to version. `init` still exists and is still a CLI mode, for the reason this section gives: it validates each id against the API before a wrong one costs the user two weeks of empty statements.
>
> Environment *variables*, never a `.env` file. §16.2 records the prior implementation auto-loading `.env` from the current working directory, which under `npx` is wherever the user happened to be standing. We read `process.env` and stop there.
>
> The cost lands on server mode. `.zshrc` is read by interactive shells, and an MCP client that spawns our process hands it the client's own environment, so the variables have to be repeated in the client config's `env` block. That is the standard mechanism for MCP servers, but it is one more step in the README that a config file would not have needed.

**Rule that follows from stdio:** nothing but JSON-RPC may reach stdout. Logging goes to stderr, always. (The `node:sqlite` `ExperimentalWarning` on Node 22 goes to stderr — harmless — but on Node 24 it doesn't exist at all, since the module is stable.)

---

## 5. MCP SDK: stable v1

**Decision:** `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk@1.x`.

v2 (`2.0.0-beta.5`) split the package along exactly the architectural axis we wanted — `core` / `server` / `express` / `node` separated, transport as a boundary package:

| Package | Direct deps |
|---|---|
| `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk@1.29.0` | **17** — including `express@5`, `hono`, `cors`, `jose`, `pkce-challenge`, `ajv` |
| `@modelcontextprotocol/server@2.0.0-beta.5` | **2** — `zod@4` + `core` |
| `@modelcontextprotocol/core@2.0.0-beta.5` | **1** — `zod@4` |

On v1, a server that only speaks stdio still installs an entire web framework and an OAuth stack.

**We are picking v1 anyway.** The `registerTool` signature is nearly identical across both, which means v2's decoupling lives in the dependency graph and in runtime portability — **not in our code**.

The dependency cost is real and should not be waved away: the rest of this ADR treats dependency minimalism as a first-class value (§7, §9's rejection of `keytar`, §10's zero native dependencies, §4's `parseArgs`), and 17 direct deps including a web framework and an OAuth stack is genuine install weight and supply-chain surface for a package strangers run via `npx` on a cold cache. **The argument for v1 is not that this cost is trivial — it is that a beta API shifting underneath the project costs more, and that migrating later is cheap precisely because the application code is identical either way.** We are accepting a known, bounded weight to avoid an unbounded churn risk.

**Revisit when:** v2 leaves beta, or a need arises to run on an edge runtime (v2 ships a `./validators/cf-worker` export).

> **Amendment, 2026-07-26 — `pluggy/transport.ts` and `pluggy/wire.ts`.** `client.ts` had two subjects in it: connections, and the wire under them (both rate-limit windows, the API key and its renewal, the 401 and 429 retries). The size sensors flagged it first, but the seam was already there, so they are separate files now. `client.ts` speaks connections; `transport.ts` owns everything between us and Pluggy's HTTP, which is what makes §16.2's promise checkable rather than merely stated: there is one function that sends, it is private to `transport.ts`, and a new endpoint cannot reach the network around it. Turning a response into one of our errors moved to `errors.ts`, since both files need it — a refused `POST /auth` and a refused `GET /items/{id}` are the same failure with a different sentence attached.

**The rule holding this together:** `src/core/` imports nothing from `src/pluggy/`, `src/storage/` or `src/mcp/`. The interfaces live in `core/contracts.ts` because the contract belongs to the consumer, not the implementer.

Enforcing this mechanically costs a third devDependency — neither `tsc` nor `@types/node` can express an import-direction constraint. Options: `dependency-cruiser`, or ESLint with `import/no-restricted-paths`. **Until one is added, the rule is convention, not enforcement**, and §7's "entire devDependencies" holds. Decide at phase 1, when `core/` first has something worth protecting; a cheap interim is a CI grep for forbidden import paths, which needs no dependency at all.

> **Amendment, 2026-07-26 — `dependency-cruiser` it is, and it enforces more than this paragraph asked for.** ESLint's `no-restricted-imports` held the boundary for a day and was withdrawn: it reads one file at a time, and a cycle, an orphan and a composition-root violation are all properties of the graph. The first cruise found `storage/db.ts ⇄ migrations.ts`, invisible to a per-file linter since the day it was written. `core/` is now barred from every npm package rather than from `pluggy-sdk` by name, so the rule survives dependencies nobody has added yet, and `cli/`/`mcp/` are barred from constructing infrastructure at all — the invariant §16.4 leans on. Rules, thresholds and the dependency-cost decision are in [docs/plans/2026-07-26-dependency-rules-design.md](../plans/2026-07-26-dependency-rules-design.md).

**Explicit naming and layout decisions:**

- Directories are **not** named after architectural patterns (`ports/`, `adapters/`). The pattern lives in the direction of dependencies, not in a folder name.
- Names in English.
- Tests in `tests/`, mirroring `src/`. Not colocated. Useful side effect: the build tsconfig becomes `include: ["src"]`, with no extra file.
- `tests/fakes/` sitting outside `src/` makes it impossible for production code to import a fake.
- No `services/` and no `utils/` — the two directories that become junk drawers and eat the domain over time.

Verified: `node --test` finds `tests/**/*.test.ts` with no arguments.

---

## 7. Tests: native runner

**Decision:** `node --test` + `node:assert`. No Jest, no Vitest, no `ts-jest`.

The project's entire `devDependencies`: `typescript` and `@types/node`.

`t.mock.timers` covers the injectable `Clock` and the 7-day freshness rule without a fake-timer library.

---

## 8. Transport

**Decision (pending confirmation — see §13):** ship stdio only, keeping the boundary ready for HTTP.

The project runs locally, single user, credentials in a local config. Streamable HTTP delivers nothing in that shape while charging for sessions, CORS, Host/Origin validation and authentication.

To be precise about the cost of deferring, because the two halves are often conflated: **wiring `core` to an HTTP transport is trivial** — the SDK's transport is a mounted handler and the server object is unchanged, so that part really is a small file. **Making it safe is not**, and that is the part being deferred. Sessions, origin validation and auth are only optional while the listener is a single local user; the moment the server is reachable, §9's entire posture ("the local disk is trusted", plaintext credentials, no authentication) stops holding, because the threat model changes from "who can read my disk" to "who can reach my port". So adding HTTP is not a 30-line change — it is a 30-line change plus a re-litigation of §9.

Factual note: "Streamable HTTP" is the protocol's transport name (POST + SSE); it has nothing to do with Node streams. The SDK implements it end to end.

---

## 9. Security: the local disk is trusted

**Decision:** posture (A) — config and data in `0600` files, unencrypted. **Stated in the README**, not assumed by omission.

**Reasoning:** protecting the `clientSecret` while the cache sits in plaintext is theatre. What does the secret grant? Access to the full financial history. What is in the SQLite file? The full financial history, already downloaded. Anyone with read access to the home directory already has the prize, with no rate limit attached.

**Refinement after reviewing prior art (§16).** The Go implementation went further than posture (A): it seals credentials, the cached API key and connect tokens with AES-256-GCM in SQLite, resolving the master key as `$OPENFINANCE_DB_KEY` → OS keychain → `~/.openfinance/master.key` (0600). That is worth taking seriously, because the argument above ("encrypting the secret is theatre while the cache is plaintext") **only holds once a transaction cache exists** — and the Go version has none, it is a stateless passthrough. Its threat model is genuinely different from ours.

For us the split is: **sealing the credential is cheap and worth doing; sealing the cache is not feasible.** `node:crypto` does AES-256-GCM with no dependency at all, so encrypting the few secret *values* costs nothing and removes the "my clientSecret leaked in a backup" failure mode. Encrypting the transaction cache would need SQLCipher, which `node:sqlite` does not have.

**Decision:** seal credential values at rest with `node:crypto` AES-256-GCM, key from `$CATA_CENTAVO_KEY` → generated keyfile at `0600`. **Skip the OS keychain tier** — that is where the Go version needs a platform binding, and it is the one rung that would cost us a native dependency (§10). Cache stays plaintext, and the README says so.

> **Amendment, 2026-07-25 — sealing is suspended, and the failure mode it addressed is gone anyway.** Credentials live in the environment. We never write them to disk, so there is no `secret.ts`, no master key, no `0600` keyfile and no sealed KV table. The one benefit the paragraph above claimed for sealing was removing "my clientSecret leaked in a backup"; not writing the secret at all removes it more completely than encrypting it would.
>
> Two things do not change. The transaction cache is still plaintext and the README still has to say so, because that argument never depended on where the credential lived. And the `apiKey` is still a secret with a two-hour life: it is now cached in memory only, which is enough because the server process lives for the whole MCP session and `init` is a single short run.
>
> What this gives up is the ability to configure the server without touching the environment, which matters for GUI MCP clients (see §4's note). Revisit the whole of this section the day a config file or a local registry comes back, because the sealed KV is the right home for both the credential and the 30-minute connect tokens of §2.

**Rejected — OS keychain:** `keytar` is a native module, which contradicts §10 head-on and makes `npx` require a per-platform build matrix.

**Rejected — encrypting the `.db`:** breaks `node:sqlite` (no SQLCipher), reintroduces a native dependency, and demands a passphrase every time the MCP client starts the server.

**Accepted and documented consequence:** anyone who can read files as the user's uid — or as root — has their full financial history. `0600` does stop a second unprivileged local account, so the exposure is "whoever is the user" rather than "whoever is on the box". The files live under `XDG_CACHE_HOME` / `XDG_DATA_HOME` (§10), which are usually but not necessarily inside `$HOME`; the permission bits, not the location, are what carry the guarantee.

Note this posture is **not** justified by "the MCP client stores secrets in plaintext anyway". Under §4, `init` writes our own config and the client config need hold no credential at all. The justification is the one above — the cache holds the same data the secret protects, so encrypting one and not the other buys nothing.

---

## 10. Persistence: two SQLite files

**Decision:** `node:sqlite` from the runtime, **zero native dependencies**, split across two files.

| File | Location | Contents | Droppable? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cache.db` | `XDG_CACHE_HOME` | accounts, transactions | **yes** — refetched from Pluggy |
| `data.db` | `XDG_DATA_HOME` | overrides, rules, closing days | **never** |

**Why split:** the original schema mixed disposable cache with irreplaceable manual work in a single file, in a directory whose name invites deletion. An `rm` to "force a refresh" would cost the user their categorization rules, with no backup and no warning.

`npx` runs from any directory, so nothing lives in the cwd. Paths resolved via XDG, with the equivalent convention on macOS.

Verified: `ATTACH DATABASE` works in `node:sqlite` and allows `JOIN`s across the two files. Splitting costs nothing in query ergonomics.

### Schema migration

`npx` always fetches the latest published version, so **we do not control when the user upgrades**. Migration stops being optional the moment a second user exists.

Verified: `PRAGMA user_version` works in `node:sqlite` — free versioning, no metadata table.

| | `cache.db` | `data.db` |
|---|---|---|
| Schema changed | `user_version` mismatch → **drop and rebuild** | a real versioned migration |
| Cost to the user | one re-sync | zero, if done right |
| Can we get it wrong? | yes, harmlessly | **no** |

The split **did not eliminate** the migration problem. It reduced the surface needing migration from "the whole schema" to three small tables. That is a large win, but it is not the same as "no longer a problem".

---

## 11. No sync of our own

Pluggy syncs with the banks daily on its own, and batch processes against the API are explicitly prohibited. **Do not build a cron.** The cache is populated on demand, at read time.

`manualUpdate` (`PATCH /items/{id}` + poll) exists for user-triggered refreshes, with a debounce measured in hours — it returns "updated X minutes ago" rather than firing again.

> **Amendment, 2026-07-26 — the debounce is Pluggy's, not ours.** Every sentence above survives; only the ownership of the last one changes. Pluggy enforces a minimum interval between client-triggered updates and refuses a `PATCH` that comes too soon with a 409 carrying `minUpdateFrequencyAllowedInHours` and the last `lastUpdatedAt`. So `init` asks unconditionally and treats that refusal as the answer, rather than keeping a timestamp of its own — which it could not do anyway, since §2's amendment leaves nothing remembered between runs.
>
> Brand-new client IDs are capped harder still, at one API update per hour, so most runs land on the refusal path. Auto-sync, meanwhile, runs every 24, 12 or 8 hours by subscription tier and on production applications only.
>
> **"Do not build a cron" is untouched, and it now has teeth.** This fires when a human types `init`, never on a schedule. Pluggy's prohibition on batch update processes is explicit.
>
> One finding worth carrying into Phase 4: for Open Finance connectors, an update does not refresh every product. Balances and recent transactions move on every update; **credit card bills, investment lists and loan instalments move once per day regardless.** Running `init` twice in an hour buys fresher balances and nothing else.

> **Amendment, 2026-07-26 — the debounce has no subject, because connector 200 refuses the `PATCH` outright.** `PATCH /items/{id}` on a healthy MeuPluggy item returns 400 `MeuPluggy item cant be updated`. That is a refusal by connector capability rather than by item state, and no request we can construct gets past it. The 409 debounce described above is real and documented; we will simply never see it, because we never get to send a request that could be too soon. `manualUpdate` is deleted rather than deferred (commit `7c63f20`), and the amendment above is superseded.
>
> **"No sync of our own" stops being a decision and becomes a description of the API surface available to us.** The cache is still populated on demand, at read time, there is still no cron, and now there is also no alternative.

So the 24h cadence the docs attribute to production applications is observably running here, and a `null` `nextAutoSyncAt` is a property of one item's state rather than of the tier or the connector. Why that item is stalled, and what moves `lastUpdatedAt` at all, are both still unknown. Source: `docs/research/2026-07-26-phase-0-5-recon.md`, §"Freshness".

## 12. Categorization

**Decision in one sentence:** a transaction's category is **not stored**. It is derived at read time, inside a single SQL query, from three independent lookups in V1 — override, counterparty, MCC — and from those plus a specificity-ranked rule engine in V2. The server never calls an LLM.

> **Amendment, 2026-07-26 — built as a harvest, and the chain has six branches, not three.** The account owner learned the plan drops to free in roughly fifteen days, which moved §12 from dormant (see §12.1's amendment) to urgent and changed its shape. The damage was never "new rows arrive uncategorized": `replaceAccount` is a full replace whose upsert sets `category_id = excluded.category_id`, so the first walk after the window overwrites today's 99.7% with `NULL`, and `cache.db` is droppable by policy. **The coverage was perishable, and it was the history that perished.**
>
> So Phase 3 is: harvest the enrichment into storage that is never dropped, while it still exists, then serve from the harvest. What changed against the design below:
>
> - **Six branches.** "What Pluggy said" exists twice — live in `cache.db`, remembered in `data.db.category_snapshot`. Manual correction beats Pluggy; the harvest loses to Pluggy, because it was derived from it. Both report `categorySrc: "pluggy"`.
> - **The roll-up moved to write time**, into a new `transactions.top_category_id`. §12.3's premise that SQL joins the taxonomy is gone: every branch emits one of the 22, so the filter compares one vocabulary against itself. This fixed a live bug — `categories: ["11000000"]` matched the leaf column and silently excluded every row tagged `11010000`, while the unfiltered call rolled those same rows into that group. Two totals for one question, which is PRD item 1.
> - **The 130-entry tree ships as code** (`src/core/taxonomy-tree.ts`), not as a `cache.db` seed. `GET /categories` was a second per-read network dependency with the same tier exposure; `Bank.getCategories` is deleted. An unknown leaf now yields `top_category_id = NULL` and a warning instead of throwing, because a tree shipped as code is out of date by construction.
> - **CPF is never learned**, only CNPJ, and only on a true majority (`agreeing * 2 > samples`). 278 of the 366 documents in the wallet are CPFs. "This CPF is Transfers" applied retroactively to every transfer to your brother is the same class of failure the rest of this ADR exists to prevent.
> - **The learned map is personal** and never committed. `mcc.ts` is universal and ships; a CNPJ map is a line of somebody's statement. Consequence, stated in the README: whoever installs after their own window closes has an empty map with nothing to harvest from.
> - **`data.db` is `ATTACH`ed onto the `cache.db` connection** as `userdata`. One connection is what lets the derivation read both files in one statement and the harvest write inside the walk's transaction. Caveat worth knowing: SQLite's cross-database atomic commit does not hold under WAL, which we enable. It is survivable only because the snapshot never deletes and never writes a `NULL` over a value.
> - **`"none"` is legal in the `categories` filter.** After the window the primary workflow is "show me what has no category so I can fix it", and no tool could express it.
>
> §12.3's V1/V2 SQL is superseded by `src/storage/category-sql.ts`. The full reasoning is in `docs/plans/2026-07-26-phase-3-categories-design.md`; the implementation steps are in the plan beside it.

### 12.1 Why this is our problem

Pluggy's free tier (Connector 200 / MeuPluggy) excludes the enrichment block. Verified against `pluggy-sdk@0.90.0`:

| Field | On the free tier |
|---|---|
| `transaction.category` / `categoryId` | comes back `null` — useless |
| `transaction.merchant.cnpj` | `merchant?` is enrichment, comes back `undefined` |
| `transaction.description` | always present, dirty and unstable text |
| `transaction.descriptionRaw` | `string \| null`, raw text from the institution |
| `transaction.creditCardMetadata.payeeMCC` | present on cards — supplied by the card network |
| `transaction.paymentData.receiver.documentNumber` | present on PIX/TED/boleto — `{type: 'CPF'\|'CNPJ', value}` |

The asymmetry that drives the design:

```
Card purchase      → has MCC, NO paymentData, NO merchant.cnpj
                     ⇒ only description + MCC remain

PIX / TED / boleto → has the counterparty's documentNumber (a stable CNPJ)
                     ⇒ reliable match by document
```

Matching by CNPJ is ideal and only exists off-card. On cards we are forced to match on text. The field that would solve it (`merchant.cnpj`) is exactly what Pluggy charges for. Caveat: `paymentData` has known holes (batch operations, deposits under R$ 2,000, fees, charges, withdrawals, yields, redemptions), so even off-card the document is not guaranteed.

> **Amendment, 2026-07-26 — the table above is not what came back, and §12 is dormant rather than dead.** Measured across 1751 transactions from three connections on 2026-07-26: `category` and `categoryId` non-null on 1745 (99.7%), agreeing with each other on every row; `merchant` on 393 (22.4%), with `merchant.cnpj` populated on all 393, cards included; `descriptionRaw` on 96.7%. `category` is always exactly the `description` of the matching `/categories` entry. The row above saying `category` "comes back `null` — useless" describes nothing this capture saw.
>
> **This does not refute §12.1, because the capture is not from the free tier.** The account is very likely on a trial or paid plan, and the honest statement of what was measured is that **the free-tier claim was never tested — there was nothing free-tier to test it against.** What these numbers describe is the shape of a tier that includes enrichment. Which fields are gated when it ends, and whether `payeeMCC` and `paymentData` — which come from the card network and the payment rails rather than from Pluggy's enrichment — are gated with them, is a question for Pluggy's support and not something these captures can answer.
>
> So the override → counterparty → MCC derivation below is **the contingency for the day enrichment goes away**, not surplus to a product that already has categories. While enrichment arrives it is a correction layer over a mostly-correct default; if it stops, it is the only source. Nothing in §12's design changes — only its urgency, and the order in which it gets built.
>
> **What is tier-independent and now settled:** `GET /categories` is a public reference endpoint serving 130 bilingual entries, and it is the obvious home for §12.4's closed list. See the amendment there.
>
> The asymmetry this section is built on is confirmed, and sharper than the prose implies: `creditCardMetadata.payeeMCC` on 1126 of 1270 card rows (88.7%, 87 distinct codes) and 0 of 481 bank rows; `paymentData.receiver.documentNumber` on 366 of 481 bank rows (76.1%) and 0 of 1270 card rows. On cards `paymentData` is not "usually absent", it is absent on 99.2% of rows. Neither signal reaches the other half of the wallet, which is exactly §12.2's argument for keeping `setCounterpartyCategory` in V1.

### 12.2 Model and scope split

| Source | Scope | Where it lives | Release |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Override** | one specific transaction | `data.db.category_overrides` | **V1** |
| **Counterparty** | every transaction with that CPF/CNPJ, retroactive | `data.db.counterparty_categories` | **V1** |
| **Default MCC** | fallback by industry | `cache.db.mcc_categories`, seeded from an ISO 18245 map in the code | **V1** |
| **Rule** | everything matching a criterion conjunction, retroactive | `data.db.category_rules` | V2 |

**V1 precedence is fixed and needs no engine:** `override > counterparty > MCC > none`. Three independent lookups, resolved by a `COALESCE`. Specificity ranking only exists in V2, where rules can combine criteria and therefore genuinely compete.

**Why counterparty is in V1 and not deferred with rules.** §12.1's asymmetry cuts the wallet in half: MCC exists only on cards, and the counterparty document exists only *off* cards. Shipping V1 with MCC alone would mean **zero automatic categorization for every PIX, TED, boleto and checking-account transaction** — in Brazil, that is most of the spending for most people. It would also make Phase 3's stated measurement ("what fraction MCC alone covers") structurally meaningless, since the answer is 0% for half the data. A document lookup is a single-column equality join; it needs none of the V2 engine, and it is what makes V1's coverage honest.

**`document` needs an explicit absent representation before it can be a join key.** §12.1 already notes `paymentData` has holes. §16 found the sharper form of the problem: in the prior implementation `documentNumber` is a value type, so a missing counterparty deserializes to `{type: "", value: ""}` and the response layer then strips the empty string entirely. If we let "absent" collapse to `""`, the counterparty subselect joins every document-less transaction to every other one and mass-mislabels them. `transactions.document` must be `NULL` when absent — never `''` — and `setCounterpartyCategory` must reject an empty document.

**Why the MCC map is a table and not a constant in code.** `getTransactions` accepts a `categories` filter (§14.2), and that filter runs in SQL. A map living in JavaScript cannot participate in the query, so filtering would silently return only overridden rows and omit every MCC-derived one. The map is therefore seeded into `cache.db.mcc_categories` by the migration that creates it — static reference data, rebuilt from code on every cache drop, never user-editable.

An override always beats a rule. Among rules, the **most specific** wins — measured by how many non-null criteria it uses. Ties break on `created_at DESC`, so the most recent correction wins.

There is no hardcoded precedence ladder (`document > description > MCC`). **Criterion counting does not reproduce such a ladder, and does not try to.** Two single-criterion rules — `{document: X} → market` and `{mcc: 5814} → restaurant` — both score 1 against a PIX transaction carrying both, so the winner is whichever was written last. A ladder would say document always wins. The two schemes agree only when the criterion counts differ. We accept the recency tiebreak as *deterministic rather than correct* (§12.7) instead of encoding a ladder, because a ladder asserts a global truth about criterion quality that our data does not support: `document` is stronger than `mcc` for a known CNPJ, and useless for the batch operations where `paymentData` is empty (§12.1).

Rules carry three nullable criteria evaluated with `AND`. The concrete motivator: `DEIVYN LANCHES` (delivery) and `DEIVYN PNEUS` (tyre shop) coexist. Matching on description alone cannot tell them apart; description **and** MCC can.

> **Amendment, 2026-07-26 — the MCC map exists, and the failure this section feared is not in the data.**
>
> **The map is built, in `src/core/mcc.ts`.** 87 MCC codes mapped to the top-level categories of §12.4's amendment, derived rather than hand-written: every card transaction carrying both an MCC and a category — 1123 of them — was grouped by MCC, each observed category rolled up to its top-level ancestor, and the most frequent ancestor won. 78 of the 87 rows are unanimous; the weakest is 12 of 25. Sample size and agreeing count are carried per row, because a 12-of-25 plurality and a 192-of-192 sweep are not the same fact. **The provenance limit is the part to state honestly:** one wallet, three institutions, 87 of roughly a thousand ISO 18245 codes. That is what §12.4 step 3 asked for — cover "the codes that actually show up in real statements" — and it is not coverage of the code space. A code nobody in this wallet spent at has no row and falls through to `none`.
>
> **The `{type: "", value: ""}` collapse is not in Pluggy's payload.** Across 1751 transactions: 366 documents present (278 CPF, 88 CNPJ), 70 rows with `receiver` explicitly `null`, 1315 with `paymentData` explicitly `null`, and **zero** empty-stringed document objects. When the counterparty is unknown, `receiver` is `null` and `documentNumber` does not exist below it. The collapse was a property of the prior implementation's value types, not of the API. **The `NULL`-not-`''` requirement stands unchanged** — it is a rule about our own deserialization discipline, and it now rests on its own merits rather than on a defence against a payload that never sends `''`.
>
> One requirement gets stricter rather than weaker. **All 366 document values carry Brazilian punctuation**, so §12.6's "digits only, punctuation stripped on write" is mandatory rather than hygiene: a raw value used as a join key would never match a user-supplied one. Type and length agree on every row — 11 digits on all 278 CPFs, 14 on all 88 CNPJs.

### 12.3 Deriving instead of storing

Measured with a synthetic 20,000 transactions × 60 rules, no index, scanned in one pass: **~150ms**. This benchmark is **V2-shaped** — it exercises the rules subselect, which V1 does not have. For V1 (a single override subselect) the cost is strictly lower, so the benchmark bounds V1 without describing it.

Two honest caveats: 20,000 rows is roughly 1,600/month for a year, not the ~500/month a lighter user sees, so treat it as the heavier end rather than a typical case; and it is **one measurement at one rule count, not a worst case** — V2 caps neither rule count nor query range. If either grows, re-measure before assuming the headroom survived.

The decision does not rest on the number anyway. Materializing a `category` column would force invalidation and recompute on every rule change, turning a bad rule into broad, irreversible damage; deleting a rule instead makes the next read correct with no recompute. That argument is about reversibility, and it holds at any latency we are plausibly going to see. (Note it is also a **V2 argument** — in V1, with only overrides, there is no rule to change and nothing to invalidate. V1 derives at read time to avoid a schema that V2 would have to undo, not to solve a problem V1 has.)

The **V1** query — three lookups, no ranking:

```sql
SELECT t.id, t.description_norm,
  COALESCE(
    (SELECT o.category FROM userdata.category_overrides o WHERE o.transaction_id = t.id),
    (SELECT c.category FROM userdata.counterparty_categories c WHERE c.document = t.document),
    (SELECT m.category FROM mcc_categories m WHERE m.mcc = t.mcc)
  ) AS category
FROM transactions t
WHERE t.date BETWEEN :from AND :to
```

The **V2** query adds the rule subselect between counterparty and MCC, and only there does specificity ranking appear:

```sql
SELECT t.id, t.description_norm,
  COALESCE(
    (SELECT o.category FROM userdata.category_overrides o
      WHERE o.transaction_id = t.id),
    (SELECT c.category FROM userdata.counterparty_categories c
      WHERE c.document = t.document),
    (SELECT r.category FROM userdata.category_rules r
      WHERE (r.description_contains IS NULL OR instr(t.description_norm, r.description_contains) > 0)
        AND (r.mcc      IS NULL OR r.mcc      = t.mcc)
        AND (r.document IS NULL OR r.document = t.document)
      ORDER BY (r.description_contains IS NOT NULL)
             + (r.mcc                  IS NOT NULL)
             + (r.document             IS NOT NULL) DESC,
               r.created_at DESC
      LIMIT 1)
  ) AS category
FROM transactions t
WHERE t.date BETWEEN :from AND :to
```

Verified behaviour of the ranked V2 form: `DEIVYN LANCHES`/5814 → delivery and `DEIVYN PNEUS`/5532 → car, both via two-criteria rules; `RESTAURANTE XY`/5814 → restaurant via an MCC-only rule; `TRANSF PIX` → market via a document rule; an unmatched row falls through to `null`.

`category_src` is not a column, but tool responses must expose it as a computed value so the agent can explain its reasoning. V1 emits `"override"`, `"counterparty"`, `"mcc"` or `"none"`; V2 adds `"rule:12"`.

> **Amendment, 2026-07-26 — the `mcc_categories` seed has a source, and it carries its own evidence.** Both queries above are unchanged; what changes is what the table is seeded from. `src/core/mcc.ts` is the map (§12.2's amendment), and each row there carries `samples` and `agreeing` beside the category, so the seed migration should carry them too. That costs two integer columns and buys two things the query cannot otherwise say: `doctor` can surface a coin-flip mapping as one, and `category_src: "mcc"` can be explained with a number attached rather than only with a source name.

### 12.4 Taxonomy is the blocking decision

**The MCC table has to be populated before anything works** — seeing MCC `5814` and returning a category presupposes that a target category exists. That makes taxonomy the *first* implementation decision, not a finishing detail.

Order matters: the ~1000 ISO 18245 codes cannot be mapped before the category list is fixed. Does `5814` become `alimentacao`, `restaurante` or `delivery`? The answer changes the entire mapping.

To do at implementation time:

1. Define **N predefined categories** as a closed, validated list. Free-form strings are rejected — they let the agent invent `alimentacao` and `alimentação` in the same database and break every aggregation.
2. **Research Pierre's taxonomy** (`docs.pierre.finance`) and Brazilian personal-finance apps, and copy one already validated in production. Personal-finance taxonomy is a solved problem, and Pierre is the reference this project already mirrors for tool design.
3. Only then map MCC → category, covering the codes that actually show up in real statements. All 1000 are not needed up front.

The category becomes a union type / `z.enum` in `core/category.ts`, and tool validation rejects anything outside the list.

> **Amendment, 2026-07-26 — decided: Pluggy's 22 top-level categories.** `GET /categories` returns 130 entries, bilingual (`description` / `descriptionTranslated`, the latter populated on all 130), and every one of the 56 `categoryId`s observed in real data exists in it, with zero orphans. We adopt the **22 top-level entries** as the closed list and roll every child up into its ancestor. That answers step 2 without the research it asks for: this is a taxonomy already validated in production, it is the one the data is already labelled with, and adopting its ids means our categories and Pluggy's line up on any tier. `src/core/category.ts` holds them as a `const` object plus a derived union (§13's pattern), with Pluggy's id as the value rather than the key.
>
> **Two constraints the implementation has to respect, both from the data rather than from taste.**
>
> - **The roll-up is transitive.** The tree is three levels deep in places — Services → Education → University, Housing → Utilities → Electricity, Transportation → Automotive → Gas stations — with 22 entries at depth 1, 81 at depth 2 and 27 at depth 3. Code that walks one level up loses the leaves. It matters because parents are used as categories in their own right alongside their own children: Transfers carries 143 rows directly against 111 across its ten children, Services 101 against 24. A group-by that does not roll up scatters one concept across a parent and its descendants. Build the tree from `parentId`, and note that three entries under Loans and financing carry a `parentDescription` disagreeing with their own `parentId` — `parentId` is the field to trust, and they sit misfiled at the source.
> - **Never slice the id.** 126 ids are 8 characters; the four Insurance children (`200100000` … `200400000`) are 9, while their parent `20000000` is 8. A "first four characters, zero-padded" rule produces `20010000`, which is not a category. All 22 **top-level** ids are themselves 8 digits, which is why the closed list is uniform even though the tree beneath it is not — and why the temptation to derive a parent positionally survives long enough to reach production.
>
> Step 3 is done as well, empirically and ahead of this section's ordering: see §12.2's amendment for the 87-code MCC map. Source: `docs/research/2026-07-26-phase-0-5-recon.md`, §"The category taxonomy".

> **Amendment, 2026-09-07 — a local block on top of the closed list.** The closed list gains top-level categories that Pluggy does not serve, for spending the user wants visible on its own rather than scattered across Pluggy's groups: **Pet** (`00000000`, pet costs otherwise split across Shopping and Healthcare), **Restaurantes** (`00000001`, eating out split off the broader Alimentos e bebidas) and **Estudo** (`00000002`, tuition and courses otherwise buried under Services). Local ids carry the `00` prefix, deliberately outside Pluggy's allocation: their sequence starts at `01`, so their next real top-level category would plausibly claim `22000000`, and a collision there would silently file a foreign category's money under a local one. Nothing derives a 00-prefix category — the MCC table stays data-derived and Pluggy never sends the id — so a row reaches one only through a user override or a manual counterparty rule. The tree in `taxonomy-tree.ts` carries the local roots apart from the served entries so the provenance stays visible.

### 12.5 Description normalization

A **pure** function living in `core/`, applied in two places: when writing `transactions.description_norm`, and when writing a rule's `description_contains`.

```
"PAG*DEIVYN LANCHES LTDA 03/12"
  → uppercase → strip accents → strip acquirer prefixes (PAG*, PG *, CIELO*, REDE*, ...)
  → strip trailing date/sequence → collapse whitespace
  = "DEIVYN LANCHES"
```

This is the highest-value unit test in the project; feed it real cases as they appear, and expect the prefix list to grow with experience rather than be right the first time. Matching is case-insensitive substring against the normalized form — exact match is useless, since the same merchant shows up as `DEIVYN LANCHES`, `PAG*DEIVYN` and `DEIVYN LANCHES LTDA 03/12`.

Normalization ships in V1 even without rules. Not because overrides need it — `setCategory` is keyed purely on transaction id and never reads `description_norm` — but because **retrofitting it later means rewriting every cached row**, and because grouping by normalized description is what lets the agent (and `getTransactions`' aggregates) present "you spent at Deivyn 7 times" instead of seven unrelated strings. The V2 discoverability resource in §12.8 depends on it too.

Regex matching is **out of V1**: it arrives as user input, needs validation, risks ReDoS stalling the server, and is more power than the real cases need. Adding it later needs no migration — a `match_mode` column defaulting to `'contains'` would cover it.

### 12.6 Tools

These are the project's first **write** tools.

**V1** — `setCategory(transactionIds: string[], category: string)` writes an override, beats everything, and validates `category` against the closed list.

**V1** — `setCounterpartyCategory(document: string, category: string)` maps a CPF/CNPJ to a category, retroactively and going forward. Digits only, punctuation stripped on write. Returns how many existing transactions it now covers, for the same reason `addRule` does. This is the non-card half of V1 coverage (§12.2).

**V2** — `addRule({ descriptionContains?, mcc?, document?, category })` (at least one criterion required, returns how many transactions it now affects plus a 5-row sample), `listRules()` (rules with affected counts), `deleteRule(id)`.

The agent is allowed to create rules on its own. That is safe because nothing is destroyed: categories are derived, so a bad rule is one `DELETE` away from being undone and the next read is already correct. The count-plus-sample return value is the safeguard — "this affects 3,400 transactions" tells both model and user the rule is too broad before they commit to it.

### 12.7 Ambiguity (V2)

Two rules of equal specificity can match the same transaction and disagree. The `created_at DESC` tiebreak makes that **deterministic, not correct**. `doctor` should detect and report rules of equal specificity whose matched sets overlap with conflicting categories.

Known residual risk: a generic rule (`DEIVYN`, no MCC) living alongside the specific ones captures any Deivyn with an unknown MCC, tyre shop included. With both present, simply do not create the generic rule — the engine cannot infer what was never declared.

### 12.8 V2: how the agent learns it can offer rules

The central V2 feature is not technical, it is **discoverability**. A user who has corrected the same merchant five times does not know rules exist, and the agent will not offer them unless something says it can.

The only discovery surface an MCP client gives a model is the **description** of tools, resources and prompts. So the affordance has to be designed there, explicitly. To settle during V2 implementation:

- `setCategory`'s description should mention that repeated overrides suggest a rule, and point at `addRule` — so the model sees the path at the moment the pattern appears.
- Consider exposing a **resource** listing recent overrides grouped by normalized description, letting the agent spot the pattern without asking.
- Consider a **prompt** ("review my categorizations") as an explicit user-initiated entry point.
- `addRule` already returns count plus sample, which gives the agent concrete material for the suggestion ("this would cover 47 transactions, including…").

### 12.9 What V1 gives up

**Rules over description text, and criterion conjunction.** The specificity engine, `category_rules`, and the three rule tools move to V2.

What V1 keeps is the retroactive path that costs nothing: `setCounterpartyCategory` covers every past and future transaction with a given CPF/CNPJ, and MCC covers cards by industry. **So "correct 300 supermarket entries one by one" is not the V1 experience** — one `setCounterpartyCategory` call handles a merchant that pays by PIX or boleto, and MCC handles it on card. What V1 genuinely cannot do is categorize by *description text*, which is the only signal left when a card purchase has an unhelpful MCC and no document. That is the gap V2 closes, and the size of it is exactly what phase 3 measures.

Introducing `category_rules` in V2 is a `CREATE TABLE` at a new `user_version` and touches no existing data, so this scope cut creates no migration debt.

**Automatic LLM categorization.** The original plan was `rule → override → MCC → LLM in batch`. Cut. Accepted consequence: **nobody opens Claude and finds everything already categorized** — someone has to ask. The agent reads the uncategorized rows, decides, and persists via `setCategory`. Revisit only after measuring, on real data, how much MCC alone already covers.

### 12.10 Alternatives rejected

| Alternative | Why not |
|---|---|
| Materialize `category` on `transactions` | Forces invalidation and recompute on every rule change; a bad rule becomes broad, irreversible damage. Deriving costs ~150ms worst case |
| Keep overrides in `cache.db.transactions` | Irreplaceable data in a disposable table. The first cache drop erases manual work |
| A single `match_type` per rule | Cannot express "description AND MCC", which is the Deivyn case |
| Hardcoded ladder `document > description > MCC` | Asserts a global ranking of criterion quality that the data does not support — `document` is the strongest signal when present and absent entirely on cards and batch operations (§12.1). Criterion counting does **not** reproduce this ordering (§12.2); we are choosing recency over a ladder, not claiming equivalence |
| Regex in V1 | ReDoS, validation burden, complexity. Deferrable at no migration cost |
| Free-form category strings | The agent invents `alimentacao` and `alimentação` in one database; aggregation breaks |
| LLM with our own API key in the server | Requires an Anthropic key on top of Pluggy, adds a dependency and a per-token cost |
| LLM via MCP sampling (`createMessage`) | Elegant — no key — but sampling is **optional** in the MCP spec and client support is uncertain. Revisit |

### 12.11 Tests this implies

Pure, no I/O, in `tests/core/`: description normalization against accumulated real cases (V1); default MCC maps to a valid taxonomy category (V1); a category outside the closed list is rejected (V1); two criteria beat one, an override beats any rule, equal specificity resolves to the most recent, and a rule with no criteria is rejected (all V2).

With SQLite `:memory:` in `tests/storage/`: the canonical query with two `ATTACH`ed files (V1, reduced form); an override survives dropping `cache.db` (V1); the full Deivyn case (V2); `deleteRule` reverts with no recompute (V2); a rule created today affects a transaction from last year (V2).

2. ~~**Which MCCs to map**, and to what. Entirely dependent on (1).~~ **Closed 2026-07-26** — 87 codes, derived from the card transactions that carried both an MCC and a category rather than chosen (§12.2's amendment).
3. ~~Should `descriptionRaw` feed normalization when `description` is poor?~~ **Closed 2026-07-26** — Phase 2 normalizes Pluggy's `description` field. `descriptionRaw` is not part of the domain row or the tool response; one description source keeps normalization deterministic.
4. `doctor` detecting ambiguity: presumably alongside V2.

> **Amendment, 2026-07-26 — points 1 and 2 are closed, and neither was decided the way this list expected.** The taxonomy was not researched and invented, it was adopted from the endpoint that already labels our data; the MCC map was not written from ISO 18245 downwards, it was derived from real card rows upwards. Point 3 is now decidable in principle — `descriptionRaw` is populated on 96.7% of rows — and point 4 still waits on V2.

## 13. Open items in this ADR

1. **§8 — transport.** stdio-only was recommended, not confirmed. If the answer turns out to be "both from the start", §6 gains `bin/http.ts` and scope grows.
2. **§3 — `enum`.** A `const` object plus derived union was recommended, because it pairs with Zod at the Pluggy boundary (a TS string enum is nominal: `"BANK"` arriving as JSON cannot be assigned without a cast, precisely where we wanted validation). Not confirmed. If real `enum`s win, `erasableSyntaxOnly` comes out and `--experimental-transform-types` goes into the dev scripts — the published package is compiled by `tsc`, so production uses no flag either way.

---

## 14. Complete tool inventory

Sixteen MCP tools plus three CLI commands. Thirteen tools ship in V1; three are V2. (Seventeen and fourteen until `manualUpdate` was removed on 2026-07-26 — §14.5 and §14.7.)

### 14.0 Naming and description conventions

Two conventions, both taken from the prior Go implementation (§16), which got them right:

**Speak the user's domain, not Pluggy's.** Pluggy calls a bank link an *item*; no human does. Tools take `connectionId`, never `itemId`, and the mapping to Pluggy's vocabulary stays inside `pluggy/mapper.ts`. The model reasons better about "connection to Nubank" than about an opaque item, and the user reads tool calls in their transcript.

**Every tool description follows the same three-part template**, because tool descriptions are the *only* discovery surface a model gets — the same fact §12.8 leans on for V2 rules:

```
<one line: what it does>

Use this tool when:
- <situation>
- <situation>

Returns: <what comes back, in domain terms>
```

The "Use this tool when" block is what stops a model from reaching for `listTransactions` when it wanted `getTransactions` aggregates. Write it for every tool, including the trivial ones.

**Open naming question, unresolved.** The Go implementation uses `snake_case` (`list_accounts`, `get_current_bill`); this document has used `camelCase` throughout, following [Pierre's MCP API](https://docs.pierre.finance/api-reference/mcp/introduction), which is the reference this project otherwise tracks. Pick one before phase 1 and apply it uniformly — the inventory below is written in camelCase and would need a mechanical pass if snake_case wins.

### 14.1 Read tools — accounts and balances

**`getAccounts()`** — V1 · effort: medium
Fans out over the configured `itemId`s and merges three endpoints (`GET /accounts`, `/investments`, `/loans`) into one shape. Returns, per account: id, institution, human-readable name, `type`, `subtype`, balance, and for cards `creditLimit`, `availableCreditLimit`, `balanceCloseDate`, `balanceDueDate`, `brand`. This is the map everything else resolves against.

**`type` cannot be Pluggy's `BANK | CREDIT` union**, because investments and loans are representable under neither. Our `type` is a superset — `BANK | CREDIT | INVESTMENT | LOAN` — and `subtype` (`CHECKING_ACCOUNT` | `SAVINGS_ACCOUNT` | `CREDIT_CARD` | …) is only meaningful for the first two. This is our type, not Pluggy's; the mapper in `pluggy/mapper.ts` owns the widening.

**`getBalance()`** — V1 · effort: trivial
Consolidated balance across accounts. **Must filter to `type === "BANK"`.** On a checking account `balance` is available money; on `CREDIT` it is the open unpaid bill — and on regulated Open Finance connectors, the used limit. Summing the two produces a meaningless number. This is pitfall #1 and it is the single easiest way to ship a tool that lies confidently.

Excluding `LOAN` follows the same logic (a debt is not money you have). Excluding `INVESTMENT` is **not** obviously right — for most people invested balance is net worth — but investments and cash are not fungible on a given day, so a single summed number would mislead in the other direction. **Decision: `getBalance` returns cash only, and reports invested and owed totals as separate labelled figures rather than folding them in.** Revisit if it proves annoying in practice.

**`getBalanceByAccount(accountId)`** — V1 · effort: trivial
`GET /accounts/{id}`. Direct passthrough with our field mapping.

> **Amendment, 2026-07-26 — the Phase 1 probe confirms both supplementary account endpoints, and unknown account types are rejected.** `GET /investments?itemId=` returned 200 for all three configured connections: two returned 21 positions and one returned none. `GET /loans?itemId=` also returned 200 for all three, with no loans observed. Phase 1 therefore reads both endpoints with `/accounts`, maps their results to `INVESTMENT` and `LOAN`, and omits the corresponding aggregate figure only when no account of that type exists. An account `type` outside the recognized wire values is a parse failure, never a default that silently changes its meaning. Evidence: `docs/research/2026-07-26-phase-1-probe.md`; the Phase 1 handling is specified in `docs/plans/2026-07-26-phase-1-accounts-and-balances-design.md`.

> **Amendment, 2026-07-26 — a pitfall worse than pitfall #1: the sign convention inverts between account types.** Measured across all 1751 transactions, without exception, and no row has `amount === 0`:
>
> | Account type | `type: DEBIT` | `type: CREDIT` |
> |---|---|---|
> | `BANK` | 305 rows, `amount` **negative** | 176 rows, `amount` **positive** |
> | `CREDIT` | 1210 rows, `amount` **positive** | 60 rows, `amount` **negative** |
>
> On a checking account money leaving is negative. On a credit card a purchase — money that will leave — is **positive**, and a payment or refund is negative. Pitfall #1 above forbids summing `BANK` and `CREDIT` because the units differ, and that argument stands untouched. This one is sharper: a mixed `SUM(amount)` does not return a meaningless number, it **partially cancels** and returns a plausible one. "You spent R$ X this month" computed across a checking account and a card lands below either half, with nothing anywhere reporting a problem. The normalization belongs in `pluggy/mapper.ts`, at the point where a Pluggy transaction becomes ours, and `type` (`DEBIT` / `CREDIT`) is what makes it decidable — present and non-null on all 1751 rows.
>
> **A second reading rule of the same class: `amountInAccountCurrency ?? amount`.** Three currencies appear — BRL 1718, USD 32, CLP 1 — and all 33 foreign rows are ordinary international card purchases, not a data fault. `amountInAccountCurrency` is non-null on exactly those 33 rows and null on all 1718 BRL rows, so Pluggy has already done the conversion and parks it precisely where `amount` is not in the account's currency. Summing `amount` naively adds dollars to reais, with 33 rows vanishing into a BRL total unsignalled. Currency *conversion* is scoped out of V1 by `docs/prd.md`; this reading rule is not, because nothing needs converting — the conversion is already done and the only way to get it wrong is to ignore the field. What stays open is presentation, whether the original amount and currency travel alongside the converted one, and whether the field behaves the same on a non-BRL account, which this wallet cannot answer.

### 14.2 Read tools — transactions

**`getTransactions({ startDate, endDate, categories?, minAmount?, maxAmount?, accountType?, accountSubtype? })`** — V1 · effort: medium
The core of the project. Pluggy's endpoint **requires `accountId`** — it does not accept an `itemId`, and it filters by neither category nor amount. So the flow is: resolve accounts → paginate each one → merge → filter locally. Category filtering works in V1 despite categories being derived, because the derivation happens in the same SQL query (§12.3).

Phase 2 uses `/v2/transactions` and applies `startDate`, `endDate`, category, account and signed cent filters from the cache. `minAmountCents` and `maxAmountCents` are bounds on the normalized signed amount. Groups roll up to the 22 top-level categories. Transfers between the user's own accounts and credit-card bill payments remain visible in `groups`, but their leaf ids are excluded from `spent` and `received`.

**Pagination has no prior art and must be built from scratch.** §16 found that the prior implementation never paginates *anything*: it decodes `totalPages` and never reads it, forwarding a single page and leaving the model to ask for more. Two endpoints send no pagination parameters at all and therefore silently receive Pluggy's default of 20 rows. The concrete rule for us:

- `pageSize = 500` (the documented maximum) on every paginated endpoint — `/transactions`, `/accounts`, `/bills`, `/investments`.
- Loop until `page >= totalPages`. **Terminate on the reported total, not on a short page**, and assert the invariant so a Pluggy change surfaces as an error rather than as missing money.
- **Never expose Pluggy's pagination envelope to the model.** The prior implementation applies local filters, rewrites `total`, leaves `totalPages` stale, and hands the model `{total: 4, totalPages: 3}` — a self-contradictory object that something is expected to reason about. Our tools return our shape (§14.0); paging that the model drives is `listTransactions`' explicit cursor, nothing else.

This is the highest-cost silent failure available to this project: nothing errors, aggregates are simply computed over a fraction of the data.

> **Amendment, 2026-07-26 — `GET /transactions` is gone, and the rule above cannot be followed.** All six accounts answer with the same body: 410, `codeDescription: ENDPOINT_DEPRECATED`, *"This endpoint is deprecated. Use GET /v2/transactions with cursor pagination instead."* Not a 404, and not a deprecation header on a working response. There is no fallback.
>
> The v2 envelope is two keys, `{ results, next }`. **No `total`, no `totalPages`, no `page`.** `pageSize`, `limit`, `page`, `perPage`, `first`, `from`, `to` and `itemId` are each rejected with a 400 naming the offending parameter (`property pageSize should not exist`); `accountId` is required and is the only parameter accepted alongside `after`. **The server picks the page size** — 500 observed on a full page, 53 on a tail, 3 on an account holding 3. **`next` is a relative query string, not a URL**: it begins with `?`, carries no host and no path, and the correct join is `${BASE}/v2/transactions${next}`. There is also no server-side date filter, so `getTransactions`' `startDate` / `endDate` is applied by us after fetching, or served from the cache.
>
> **Say it plainly: the invariant is gone, not relocated to a different field.** "Terminate on the reported total, not on a short page, and assert it" has nothing left to assert against, and a short page now carries no information at all — the 53-row tail and the 3-row single page are the same shape. What replaces it, for `/v2/transactions` only:
>
> - **Terminate on `next === null`, and on nothing else.**
> - **Cap the hop count and fail loudly on the cap**, because "loop until the server says stop" has no natural bound if the cursor stops advancing.
> - **Assert the cursor advances.** Two consecutive responses carrying the same `after`, or a page returning rows already seen, is an error. This is the closest survivor of the old assertion and it is strictly weaker: it catches a loop that sticks, not a fetch that stops early.
> - The old rule applies unchanged to `/accounts`, `/bills` and `/categories`, which are still offset-paginated and still return `{total, totalPages, page, results}`.
>
> **This section's own named failure mode was reproduced by accident during the capture that found the deprecation.** The first pass of the fetch script joined `next` as though it were a path, requested something that was not the next page, and stopped: 500 rows from an account holding 1053, no error, a plausible-looking result. "Nothing errors, aggregates are simply computed over a fraction of the data" — written above as a warning, and hit within the first hour of contact with the new endpoint by the people who wrote it.

**Deliberate divergence from Pierre:** Pierre offers `format: 'raw' | 'structured'`. We do not copy that. A model handed the choice picks `raw` and blows its own context. This tool returns **aggregates by default**, and detail is reached through explicitly bounded paths.

Each aggregate group carries **`sampleIds`, capped at 10**, alongside `label`, `total` and `count`:

```jsonc
{ "label": "Mercado", "total": -4200.00, "count": 37, "sampleIds": ["...", "..."] }
```

An earlier draft of this ADR said "always returns aggregates" with no ids at all. That was **circular and unimplementable**: `getTransactionDetails(ids)` and `setCategory(transactionIds)` both require ids, and no V1 tool emitted any. The agent literally could not reach the write path. Capping the sample is what actually protects the context window; withholding ids entirely protected nothing and broke the product.

**`listTransactions({ ...same filters, limit, cursor })`** — V1 · effort: low
Explicit paging when the agent needs the full set rather than a sample — bulk categorization being the motivating case. **Hard cap `limit <= 100`**, cursor-based. Returns rows with `id`, `date`, `description_norm`, `amount`, `category`, `category_src`.

The rule is therefore "**aggregated by default, explicit paging with a hard ceiling**", not "aggregated only". The ceiling is the safeguard; the aggregate default is the nudge.

**`getTransactionDetails(ids: string[])`** — V1 · effort: low
Full domain rows for an explicit set of at most 20 ids. Money crosses the MCP boundary as decimal strings. The response exposes our names for counterparty, payment, instalment, purchase, MCC and bill fields; it does not return Pluggy's `paymentData` or `creditCardMetadata` blobs.

> **Amendment, 2026-07-26 — Phase 2 is implemented.** `getTransactions` groups by the 22 top-level category ids, accepts signed cent filters, and excludes the transfer leaves `04000000` and `05100000` from the headline totals. `listTransactions` is cursor-paged with a hard limit of 100. `getTransactionDetails` is capped at 20 ids and returns the normalized domain shape.

**`getInstallments()`** — V1 · effort: **high** · implement last
There is no "installment purchase" entity in Pluggy. It is reconstructed from card metadata: `installmentNumber`, `totalInstallments`, `totalAmount` (the sum of all installments), `payeeMCC`, `cardNumber`, `billId`. Group by `description|totalAmount|totalInstallments`, take the max `installmentNumber` as paid, and derive what remains.

Behaviour varies by institution: some post every installment right after the purchase, others one per bill. Do not generalize from a single bank. This is why it is last on the roadmap — it needs real data from *your* banks in hand.

> **Amendment, 2026-07-26 — the grouping recipe names a field that does not exist.** `creditCardMetadata` carries no `totalAmount` key on any of 1270 card rows. Its members are `billId`, `installmentNumber`, `totalInstallments`, `cardNumber`, `payeeMCC`, `billForecastDate`, `purchaseDate`, `feeType`, `feeTypeAdditionalInfo`, `otherCreditsType` and `otherCreditsAdditionalInfo`. **Group by `description | totalInstallments | purchaseDate`.**
>
> Substituting the row's own `amount` for the missing `totalAmount` is not a safe fallback — it fabricates groups. On the author's card B it yields 55 groups where `purchaseDate` yields 56, by merging two unrelated purchases that happen to share a description, an amount and an instalment count into a single group of twelve rows, which then reads as "a 12× purchase posted all at once". `purchaseDate` is present on 120 of the 122 instalment rows in the wallet, absent only on the two belonging to the partial connection.
>
> **"Do not generalize from a single bank" is confirmed inside a single wallet.** Card C posts strictly one instalment per bill, 18 times out of 18. Card B posts several at once on 37 of its 56 instalment purchases, up to five rows for one purchase. `totalInstallments` values seen: 2, 3, 5, 10, 12. Nothing here reaches the 45×-instead-of-9× case §14.3 warns about, but the direction of the error is confirmed and the guard is needed. Source: `docs/research/2026-07-26-phase-0-5-recon.md`, §"Step 6".
>
> **Amendment, 2026-07-27 — the recommended grouping key failed its Phase 4 measurement.** `description | totalInstallments | purchaseDate` was the worst of the eight keys tried against the two live posting styles. No candidate grouped both cards correctly. Phase 6 inherits the full sweep in `docs/research/2026-07-26-phase-4-open-bill-derivation.md`; the key above is evidence from an earlier sample, not a recipe.

### 14.3 Read tools — credit cards

**`getBills(accountId)`** — V1 · effort: low
`GET /bills?accountId=`. Closed bills: `dueDate`, `billClosingDate`, `totalAmount`, `minimumPaymentAmount`, `financeCharges`, `payments`. **An empty list is a legitimate normal case, not an error** — bills are mandatory only under regulated Open Finance; on Direct connections only Inter PF and Itaú Cartões supply them.

**`getBillSummary(accountId)`** — V1 · effort: medium
The current, still-open bill. Combines `account.creditData` with the transactions belonging to the open bill. Returns closing date (with the local override as fallback), due date, partial total, credit limit, available limit and usage ratio.

**Which signal identifies an open-bill transaction is unresolved.** This ADR previously asserted that the `PENDING` / `POSTED` split partitions open from closed and "comes free from the API". The prior implementation (§16) — written against real data — does not use `status` at all. `Transaction.Status` is modelled in its entities and **never read anywhere in the codebase**; open-bill detection is `creditCardMetadata.billId == ""`. Two signals, one asserted and one battle-tested, and they may or may not agree. **Resolve in Phase 0.5.** Getting this wrong makes `getBillSummary` silently wrong about the number the user cares most about.

Two further constraints inherited from §16's analysis of the prior implementation:

- **Do not exclude transactions that lack `creditCardMetadata`.** The prior version skips them, which drops card payments, annuity fees, interest and IOF from the itemization while leaving them inside `account.balance` — so its headline figure and its line items are computed over different populations.
- **Guard the installment deduction against banks that post all installments upfront.** Deducting `amount × (totalInstallments − installmentNumber)` per row assumes one row per bill. On a bank that posts all ten rows of a 10× purchase at once, that deducts 45× the installment instead of 9×. §14.2 already records that posting behaviour varies by institution; this is where it does damage.

> **Amendment, 2026-07-26 — the open-bill signal is resolved, and neither of the two candidates was right.** Cross-tabulated over 1270 card transactions:
>
> | `status` | `billId` present | `billId` key absent |
> |---|---:|---:|
> | `POSTED` | 1196 | 0 |
> | `PENDING` | 2 | 72 |
>
> **`billId` is never an empty string.** When it is absent the key is omitted from the object entirely — not `null`, not `""`. The prior implementation's `billId == ""` test would have matched zero rows out of 1270 and reported an empty open bill on every card. **The `PENDING` / `POSTED` split is close but has two real exceptions:** `POSTED ⇒ billId present` holds 1196 out of 1196, while two `PENDING` rows carry a `billId`, and both resolve to bills `/bills` actually returns. The two signals agree on 1268 of 1270 rows — exactly the confidence profile that lets a wrong choice survive testing and fail in production. Both exceptions sit on the three-transaction card, a sample too small to say whether it is an institution quirk or a state a fuller card also passes through.
>
> **What the data supports:** treat `billId != null` as "belongs to bill X", because it names a bill that exists, and `status === "POSTED"` as corroboration rather than as the key. `status === "PENDING"` and a missing `billId` both mean "not yet on a closed bill"; where they disagree, the `billId` is the stronger claim. The join is clean in both directions — 26 bills fetched, 26 distinct `billId`s on transactions, no orphan on either side.
>
> **Every credit transaction carries `creditCardMetadata`** — 1270 of 1270, against 0 of 481 bank rows. The bullet above costs nothing to honour on this wallet because there is nothing to exclude: the fee and credit rows it is about are present and do carry the object (`feeType` on 225 rows, `otherCreditsType` on 213), arriving with a `billId` and without a `payeeMCC`.
>
> **Absence is signalled two different ways depending on nesting depth, and that decides how the Zod schemas in `pluggy/wire.ts` are written.** Top-level transaction fields are always present and explicitly `null` — all 23 keys on all 1751 rows, no key ever omitted and no value ever `""`. Fields nested inside `creditCardMetadata` are **omitted entirely** when absent, with zero explicit nulls (`billId` absent on 72, `purchaseDate` on 1150, `payeeMCC` on 144). The same holds one level further down: `paymentData.receiver` is explicitly `null`, but `receiver.documentNumber` either exists or its key does not. So `.nullable()` at the top level and `.optional()` on nested members, and the two are not interchangeable — which is also where `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` earns its place.
>
> One confirmation for the tool below: **`creditData.balanceCloseDate` is `null` on all three cards.** Pitfall #6 is not hypothetical on this connector, and `manageClosingDate` is the only source of a closing day. `billClosingDate` *is* populated on the 24 bills of the two full cards, so the date exists per bill even where it is missing from the account.

> **Amendment, 2026-07-27 — Phase 4 refines the open-cycle signal and the two bill figures.** A row belongs to the open cycle when its `billId` matches a bill that `/bills` publishes as open, or when it has no `billId` and its forecast is absent or no later than the open cycle. A published bill is open when its closing date has not passed. The live sandbox added a second case: a null closing date with a future due date is also open. This supersedes the 2026-07-26 shorthand that every present `billId` names a closed bill.
>
> `getBillSummary` returns `posted`, `committed` and their absolute `gap`, alongside utilization and the date through which transaction data is available. `posted` normally comes from open-cycle rows. When `/bills` publishes the open cycle, its total is authoritative: the live sandbox rows included a positive payment that the provider misclassified, and their sum was zero while the published bill total was 265.50. `committed` remains utilization minus instalments assigned to later cycles. The two figures are independent measurements, not proven bounds, so the tool reports both and does not pick a hidden headline number.
>
> **Bills are not cached.** §11 records that bills may refresh only once a day, but each bill tool still wants the newest list. Reading three live lists costs three requests per wallet. Caching them would add a cache migration, a table, invalidation and a freshness rule to save those requests. It would also leave `getBillSummary` reconciling three snapshots: cached transactions, cached bills and the current account utilization. Phase 4 reads bills live on every request, keeps transactions cached with `dataThrough`, and uses `staleDays` to state the age difference.

**`listClosingDays()` · `setClosingDay(accountId, day)` · `deleteClosingDay(accountId)`** — V1 · effort: low
Purely local CRUD over `data.db.card_closing_day`. `setClosingDay` is an upsert, and the stored day is clamped to the target month's length when used. The three verbs replace `manageClosingDate`; the operation-enum question is closed.

### 14.4 Write tools — categorization

**`setCategory(transactionIds: string[], category: string)`** — V1 · effort: low
Writes an override into `data.db`. Beats any rule. `category` is validated against the closed taxonomy (§12.4). See §12.6.

**`addRule({ descriptionContains?, mcc?, document?, category })`** — V2
**`listRules()`** — V2
**`deleteRule(id)`** — V2
Specified in §12.6. The agent may create rules unaided because nothing is destroyed and a bad rule is one `DELETE` from undone.

### 14.5 Operations and observability

**`manualUpdate(connectionId)`** — V1 · effort: low
`PATCH /items/{id}`, then poll `GET /items/{id}` until `executionStatus` reaches `SUCCESS` or `PARTIAL_SUCCESS`. Rate limited to 20/min, and documented as being for *user-triggered* refreshes — daily updating is the auto-sync's job (§11). **Debounce measured in hours**, returning "updated X minutes ago" rather than firing again.

> **Amendment, 2026-07-26 — built, in `core/refresh.ts`, and reached first through `init` rather than as a tool.** The signature above said `itemId`, against §14.0's own rule; it is `connectionId` now.
>
> Three corrections the implementation forced:
>
> - **The loop condition is `status === "UPDATING"`, not an `executionStatus` allowlist.** That is what Pluggy's own polling recipe does, and it is the safer shape: everything else terminates, so a status neither we nor the docs have seen ends the loop and gets reported instead of spinning for nineteen minutes. Pluggy's OpenAPI schema declares both fields bare `string` with no enum, and its prose docs and its SDK disagree about the members, down to the spelling of the investments one. Closing either union would have been a mistake.
> - **20/min needs its own window.** The general limit is 360/min, so one shared limiter lets a fan-out of reads spend a budget the updates need. `transport` now claims a second window for `PATCH /items/`, in the same choke point and for the same §16.2 reason.
> - **`WAITING_USER_INPUT` is a first-class outcome, not an error.** The item carries the label of what the bank wants — "Chave de segurança" — and reporting that label is the difference between an actionable message and a shrug. Answering it (`POST /items/{id}/mfa`) is deliberately not built: `init` is non-interactive per §14.6, and a `LOGIN_ERROR` cannot be fixed from the API at all, only through Pluggy Connect.

> **Amendment, 2026-07-26 — `manualUpdate` is deleted, and the amendment above with it.** Connector 200 refuses `PATCH /items/{id}` unconditionally (§11's amendment), so the tool could not have worked for any user of this project — connector 200 is the only one it supports. Commit `7c63f20` removed `core/refresh.ts`, `cli/progress.ts`, `Bank.refreshConnection`, `UPDATE_RATE_LIMIT` and the second rate-limit window, together with their tests. This is a deletion, not a deferral: nothing is waiting behind a flag, and the tool is off §14.7's inventory. The three corrections recorded above were all correct and are all moot.
>
> **Two things survive it.** The read path kept the **error-envelope parsing** and the **429 backoff** built alongside the refresh, because both are about talking to Pluggy at all rather than about updating an item. And `Connection.parameter` and `Connection.warnings` survive, because a `GET /items/{id}` still carries them: an item can sit in `WAITING_USER_INPUT` with a labelled parameter, or come back `PARTIAL_SUCCESS` with warnings naming a product that hit its quota, whether or not we were the ones who asked it to sync. Reporting the label of what the bank wants is still the difference between an actionable message and a shrug — that part was never about the `PATCH`.

**`listSources()`** — V1 · effort: trivial · not in Pierre
Returns the configured `itemId`s with institution, last sync, item `status` / `executionStatus`, and consent state. Given §2, this is the closest thing to an item listing that can exist.

It **mitigates pitfall #7** (revoked consent returns empty data, not an error) outright, via `fetchConsents`. It **does not mitigate pitfall #8** — a bank connected in MeuPluggy whose UUID never reached the config is, by §2, unobservable: the tool enumerates the config, and an item absent from the config is definitionally invisible to it. What `listSources` provides against #8 is only the raw material for the user to notice a gap themselves, by comparing the listed sources against the banks they know they linked. **Pitfall #8 is unmitigable in software under §2** and belongs in the README as an operational warning, not in a tool's justification.

### 14.6 CLI commands (not MCP tools)

**`init`** — interactive. Collects `clientId` / `clientSecret`, accepts `itemId`s one at a time, calls `fetchItem` on each to validate immediately, and writes the config. Turns a pasted-UUID mistake into a two-second error instead of two weeks of empty statements. Cannot be a tool, because stdio is the JSON-RPC channel (§4).

> **Amendment, 2026-07-25 — `init` validates, it does not collect and it does not write.** It reads the environment, authenticates once, calls the item endpoint on every configured id and prints a per-id report to stderr. Everything the original sentence promised about catching a pasted UUID still holds; only the writing is gone.
>
> One id failing does not abort the others. A report covering every connection is worth more than a report that stops at the first bad line, and the exit code carries the failure instead.
>
> This costs `init` its reason to be a CLI mode rather than a tool, since nothing interactive is left. It stays a CLI mode regardless, because a tool cannot be reached before the credentials it is diagnosing are known to work.

> **Amendment, 2026-07-26 — `init` still does not write locally, but it does write to Pluggy.** It asks every configured connection to sync (§14.5) and waits for the result. "It does not write" was about our disk and stays true; a `PATCH` is nonetheless a side effect that spends Open Finance product quota and sits under a 20/min ceiling, so the earlier sentence was too broad and this replaces it.

> The read still comes before the update, for two reasons that are both worth the extra request: a 404 catches a mis-pasted UUID before anything is spent, and the institution's name has to be on screen before a wait that can run for minutes, or the spinner shows a UUID the whole time.
>
> **Five outcomes replace pass/fail,** because "unusable" was hiding differences a user has to act on differently: *refreshed*, *already fresh* (the 409 of §11), *waiting on you* (MFA, naming the parameter), *login refused* (Pluggy Connect only), and *still syncing* (we ran out of patience; Pluggy has not). Only the first two count as usable and exit 0.
>
> **A `PARTIAL_SUCCESS` exits 0 and prints its warnings.** A product that hit its monthly Open Finance quota went unrefreshed, which means the numbers under it are older than the rest — worth a `!` and a line naming the product, and not worth failing over.
>
> Waiting silently for minutes is not acceptable, so `init` draws a live region on stderr: a spinner and the current stage per connection on a terminal, one plain line per stage change anywhere else. Stdout stays empty either way (§4).

> **Amendment, 2026-07-26 — `init` is read-only again, in both senses, and the amendment above is superseded.** It does not write to our disk and it no longer writes to Pluggy: one `GET /items/{id}` per configured id, issued in parallel, reported per id on stderr. The `PATCH` the previous amendment was built around is refused by connector 200 (§11), so "it does not write" is true without the qualification that amendment added.
>
> **The five outcomes collapse back to two — usable and failed.** *Already fresh*, *waiting on you* and *still syncing* were all states of a sync we now never trigger. The live stderr region, the spinner and the per-connection stage table went with the poll loop (`cli/progress.ts`, deleted in `7c63f20`), because there is no longer a wait to narrate: three parallel `GET`s finish in the time it takes to print them. What the 2026-07-25 amendment said therefore holds again, unchanged: one id failing does not abort the others, and the exit code carries the failure. Storage is still prepared before the network, so a `data.db` this release cannot read is reported without spending a round of API calls first.

**`doctor`** — diagnostics over every configured item: `status`, `executionStatus`, `statusDetail`, `lastUpdatedAt`, `consecutiveFailedLoginAttempts`, consent `expiresAt` / `revokedAt`, plus cache freshness and schema versions. In V2 it also reports rule ambiguity (§12.7).

**(default, no argument)** — the MCP server over stdio.

## 15. Implementation roadmap

Each phase is shippable and answers a question the next phase depends on. Phases 0 and 7 did not exist in the original plan; they are the cost of §1 (a real audience) and §4 (a CLI).

### Phase 0 — Foundations and onboarding

Config format and its versioning, XDG path resolution, `parseArgs` dispatch, both SQLite files with `PRAGMA user_version` and the migration runner, and `init` end to end.

**Auth discipline**, which §16 shows is where the prior implementation breaks in practice. It resolves the 2h `apiKey` once in the client constructor and freezes it on a struct field — no refresh, no expiry check, no 401 retry path. An MCP client keeps the server process alive for a whole session, so after two hours every tool returns an opaque status-code error. Our rules:

- Cache the key with a real **margin** (expire locally around 1h50m), not at Pluggy's full lifetime.
- Resolve it **lazily per request**, not once at startup — and never per request in the sense of re-authenticating; the cache is what prevents that.
- Guard the refresh with a **single-flight**, or the account fan-out issues N concurrent `POST /auth` calls.
- One forced refresh and retry on a 401, then fail loudly.

*Delivers:* a user can install and configure. *Answers:* are the credentials and item IDs even valid.

> **Amendment, 2026-07-25.** Config format and its versioning leave this phase (see §4). What remains is XDG path resolution, `parseArgs` dispatch, the two SQLite files with their migration runner, `init`, and the auth discipline above. Both migration chains start empty, because no table this project has decided on belongs to a phase this early; the runner ships anyway so Phase 1 costs one array entry instead of a design.
>
> **The premise of the auth paragraph does not transfer to the Node SDK.** "Resolves it once in the constructor and freezes it" is true of the Go implementation and false of `pluggy-sdk@0.90.0`, whose `baseApi.js` resolves the key at the head of every request and checks the JWT `exp` first. One of the four rules above is therefore already satisfied. The other three are not, and none of them can be added from outside:
>
> | Rule | `pluggy-sdk` |
> |---|---|
> | lazily per request | already does it |
> | margin | `payload.exp <= now`, so a token with 200ms left passes the check and the request 401s |
> | single-flight | a plain async method; the account fan-out of §14.1 issues N concurrent `POST /auth` |
> | 401 retry | `got` is configured to retry `429` and nothing else |
>
> The cached key is private instance state, so a margin cannot be injected. The SDK also has no rate limiter at all, which puts §16.2's rule ("the limiter goes inside the single send function, so a new endpoint cannot forget it") out of reach as long as the send function belongs to someone else.
>
> **Decision: our own client over `fetch`.** One `send()` carrying the rate limit, the key with its margin and single-flight, the 401 retry, the 429 backoff, and later the pagination of §14.2. `pluggy-sdk` stays installed as a source of types.
>
> **Second finding: the SDK's types are only true inside the SDK.** `item.d.ts` declares `lastUpdatedAt: Date | null`, and that holds because the SDK installs a reviver in `got` (`transforms.js` turns any ISO-8601 string into a `Date`). Parsing raw JSON ourselves, the field is a `string` at runtime while the type says `Date` — the shape of bug §16.2 was written to warn about. So: string unions come from the SDK (`ItemStatus` is `typeof ITEM_STATUSES[number]`, exact at runtime and already the no-`enum` pattern of §13), and records are described with Zod in `pluggy/wire.ts`, where the type is inferred from what we actually parse. That is Phase 0.5's "trust nothing but the raw HTTP body" written as code instead of as discipline.
>
> The rate limit value stays one named constant, defaulting to 360/min. Phase 0.5 step 4 has to settle it; until then the default is chosen on failure mode, since guessing too high costs a 429 and a retry while guessing too low makes the Phase 1 fan-out crawl and look broken.

> **Amendment, 2026-07-26 — the phase grows `manualUpdate`, and two items come off `send()`'s to-do list.** `init` now triggers and waits on a sync per §14.5, which pulled that tool forward from Phase 5. Two of the things `send()` was promised to carry are built because this made them load-bearing: the **429 backoff**, honouring `Retry-After` for a bounded number of retries, and a **second rate-limit window** for `PATCH /items/` at 20/min. Pagination is still Phase 1's.
>
> A third was not on the list and should have been: **the error body**. `classify` threw the status and dropped everything else, so the first real 400 read "Pluggy returned 400 while refreshing connection …" and named neither of the four causes Pluggy documents for it. That is §16.2's scar with our name on it. Every non-2xx now parses Pluggy's envelope and repeats its `codeDescription`, `message` and `canRetryAfterDate`.
>
> What remains for Phase 0.5 step 4 is unchanged, with one addition: the 20/min figure for updates is documented plainly and needs no confirming, but whether the general limit is per minute or per hour still does.

> **Amendment, 2026-07-26 — the phase loses `manualUpdate` again, and one of the two `send()` items goes with it.** The refresh is deleted rather than returned to Phase 5 (§14.5). The **second rate-limit window** for `PATCH /items/` goes with it: one window again, 360/min, which is §16.2's rule with nothing left to qualify it. The **429 backoff** stays, because any endpoint can answer 429, and so does the error-body parsing added in the same amendment, which is the more valuable of the two — §14.2's `ENDPOINT_DEPRECATED` is a 410 whose body names its own replacement, and a client that threw the status code alone would have reported "Pluggy returned 410" and left someone to guess. Pagination is still unbuilt and is now cursor-shaped rather than offset-shaped (§14.2's amendment).
>
> Phase 0.5 step 4 is unchanged and still open: whether the general limit is per minute or per hour. The 20/min figure stops mattering, since we never send an update.

### Phase 0.5 — Reconnaissance before writing feature code

Before any tool exists, hit the API by hand and confirm, against **your** banks:

```bash
curl -H "X-API-KEY: $KEY" "https://api.pluggy.ai/accounts?itemId=$ITEM"
curl -H "X-API-KEY: $KEY" "https://api.pluggy.ai/transactions?accountId=$ACC"
```

Checklist, in descending order of how much a wrong answer would cost:

1. **Is transaction `id` stable across re-syncs?** Fetch a range, force a `manualUpdate`, fetch the same range again, and diff the ids. **§12's entire override design depends on this** — `category_overrides` is keyed on `transaction_id`, and §10 says `cache.db` gets dropped and rebuilt on any schema change. If Pluggy re-issues ids on re-fetch, every override orphans on the first cache rebuild and the two-file split buys nothing for overrides. Nothing else in this ADR establishes this; a `:memory:` SQLite test proves our SQL preserves rows, not that Pluggy preserves ids. If ids turn out unstable, overrides need a synthetic key (date + amount + normalized description) and §12 needs revisiting before Phase 3.
2. **Is Connector 200 / MeuPluggy a regulated Open Finance connector or a Direct one?** Three separate decisions branch on the answer and none of them currently know it: the 7-day freshness window (Phase 1), the `CREDIT` balance semantics (§14.1), and whether `getBills` returning empty is normal (§14.3). Resolve this once, here.
3. **Does an open-bill transaction carry `status: PENDING`, an empty `creditCardMetadata.billId`, or both?** §14.3 and the prior implementation disagree, and `getBillSummary` is wrong if we pick the wrong one. Pull one open and one closed bill and compare both fields on every row.
4. **Is the free-tier rate limit 360/minute or 360/hour?** The project spec records 360/min per IP on `GET /transactions`; the prior implementation hardcodes `maxRequests = 360` over `rateLimitDuration = time.Hour`. That is a 60× difference, it decides whether the transaction fan-out in §14.2 is free or is the binding constraint, and neither source is authoritative — one of them is a mistake. Check the current docs, and if still ambiguous, measure.
5. Confirm `category` / `merchant` really do come back null. **Trust nothing but the raw HTTP body here** — §16 found the prior implementation could not have observed this, because its response serializer strips empty values and its `category` field collapses `null` to `""`, deleting the evidence before a human sees it.
6. Check whether `item.connector` shows the real institution or just "MeuPluggy" — this determines whether `source` can be built at all (§10 denormalization).
7. Check whether `paymentData` carries the counterparty on **your** banks, and how often it is missing — and whether absent arrives as `null` or as an empty-stringed object (§12.2).

Capture the raw JSON as test fixtures. Pluggy's Discord is the support channel for personal use, with answers in hours.

*Answers:* what the data actually looks like, which is the input to every later estimate — and, via (1) and (2), whether §12 and Phase 1 are built on solid ground.

> **Amendment, 2026-07-26 — run, and five of the seven are answered.** `docs/research/2026-07-26-phase-0-5-recon.md` is the capture: three connections, six accounts, 1751 transactions, 26 bills, 130 categories, read-only, recomputed from raw bodies. Note before anything else that **the two `curl` lines above no longer work** — `GET /transactions` answers 410 on every account (§14.2's amendment), and the working form is `GET /v2/transactions?accountId=`.
>
> | Step | Status |
> |---|---|
> | 1 — transaction id stability across a re-sync | **open**, and it costs more to answer now (below) |
> | 2 — regulated or Direct connector | closed by `docs/research/pluggy-item-update.md`: **neither.** Connector 200 is Pluggy's own aggregator — `isOpenFinance: false`, no credentials, `oauth: true` against `meu.pluggy.ai`, with the real Open Finance connection one level down where we cannot see it |
> | 3 — the open-bill signal | closed — §14.3's amendment |
> | 4 — 360 per minute or per hour | **open.** Nothing was measured against it: the capture paced itself at 200ms and never came close to either bound, and no `RateLimit-*` or `Retry-After` header appears on a successful response, so a 429 has to be provoked to read the answer |
> | 5 — do `category` and `merchant` come back null | closed — §12.1's amendment. On this tier they do not, and the free-tier claim was never testable |
> | 6 — does `item.connector` show the institution | closed by `pluggy-item-update.md`: it is `"MeuPluggy"`, never the bank, so `source` has to come from the accounts |
> | 7 — does `paymentData` carry the counterparty | closed — §12.2's amendment. 76.1% of bank rows, 0% of card rows, and never empty-stringed |
>
> **Step 1 now needs a human in the loop.** The plan was fetch → `manualUpdate` → fetch → diff. `PATCH /items/{id}` is refused by connector 200, so the forced sync is unavailable from the API at all, and answering this requires a **manual refresh inside meu.pluggy.ai between two captures**. Until that is run, `category_overrides` keyed on `transaction_id` rests on an assumption — which is the same standing this section gave it, at a higher price. All 1751 ids are distinct and UUIDv4-shaped; that is a precondition, not an answer, since a server-generated id can be stable or re-issued and the shape does not say which.
>
> The run also answered questions nobody had put on this checklist, which is the argument for the phase existing: the deprecation of `GET /transactions` (§14.2), the sign inversion (§14.1), the absence convention that decides how `wire.ts` is written (§14.3), and the taxonomy (§12.4). It left open items of its own, listed in the research document's last section — chief among them which enrichment fields disappear when this account lands on the free tier.

### Phase 1 — Accounts and balances

`getAccounts`, `getBalance`, `getBalanceByAccount`. The lazy cache path in `storage/`, plus the `Clock` port and the 7-day freshness rule — freshness only matters for the last 7 days, since regulated Open Finance connectors update within a 7-calendar-day window including today, and anything older is immutable in practice and must not be revalidated.

*Delivers:* the account map. *Answers:* is the credential/item/account chain sound.

> **Amendment, 2026-07-26 — Phase 1 has no lazy cache path or 7-day freshness rule.** Connector 200 reports `isOpenFinance: false`; `PATCH /items/{id}` is refused; and one connection was stalled for three days with no diagnosable cause. Phase 1 reads accounts directly from Pluggy and reports freshness per connection through `lastUpdatedAt`; it does not control or gate on freshness. Evidence: `docs/research/2026-07-26-phase-0-5-recon.md`, `docs/research/2026-07-26-phase-1-probe.md`. The decision rationale is in `docs/plans/2026-07-26-phase-1-accounts-and-balances-design.md`.

### Phase 2 — Transactions

`getTransactions` (aggregates with capped `sampleIds`), `listTransactions` (paged, `limit <= 100`) and `getTransactionDetails`. Description normalization lands here, because `description_norm` is written on cache insert. The response shape and its token budget must be settled here — this is the tool that can blow a context window.

Note this phase consumes the category list fixed in phase 1, since `getTransactions` takes a `categories?` filter validated against it.

*Delivers:* the core of the product. *Answers:* the real quality of the data, and therefore how much categorization work remains.

### Phase 3 — Taxonomy, MCC and overrides

Research Pierre's taxonomy, fix the N categories, build the MCC → category table, ship `setCategory` and the derived-category query.

**Two halves with different dependencies**, and the earlier version of this ADR wrongly claimed the whole phase "blocks on nothing but a decision":

- *Fixing the category list* is a pure decision, depends on nothing, and should be pulled **forward to Phase 1** — see the ordering note below.
- *Mapping MCC → category* is empirical. §12.4 step 3 says to cover "the codes that actually show up in real statements", which is data from Phase 0.5 and Phase 2. It cannot be completed before them.

**Ordering correction.** §12.4 calls taxonomy "the *first* implementation decision" and §12.12 calls it "Blocks V1", yet it sits fourth here. Both cannot be true. The resolution: **the category list moves into Phase 1** (it is a decision, and `getTransactions` in Phase 2 takes a `categories?` parameter validated against it — a Phase-2 tool cannot consume a Phase-3 artifact). The MCC mapping stays in Phase 3, where the data exists. What "blocks V1" accurately means is "blocks any tool that names a category", not "blocks all work".

Ships `setCategory`, `setCounterpartyCategory`, the `mcc_categories` seed table, and the three-lookup `COALESCE` query of §12.3.

*Delivers:* usable categories across the whole wallet — MCC on cards, counterparty off cards. *Answers:* **what fraction is still uncategorized after override, counterparty and MCC.** That residue is by construction the description-matching gap, and its size is the number that decides whether V2 rules are urgent or optional. Measure it per account type, since cards and checking accounts fail for different reasons.

> **Amendment, 2026-07-26 — this phase's headline answer was measured before the phase started: 14.8%.** 259 of 1751 transactions carry neither an MCC nor a counterparty document, so they are precisely what override, counterparty and MCC cannot reach and description text is the only signal left on them. Per account type, as this section asks for: cards carry an MCC on 88.7% of rows and a document on none of them; checking accounts carry a document on 76.1% and an MCC on none. The two halves fail for different reasons and neither mechanism reaches the other's. (The 14.8% is a ceiling on automatic coverage from signal availability, not a count of rows a user would call wrong — an MCC that resolves to the wrong category is still a row someone has to correct.)
>
> So **V2's necessity is now a judgement about one number rather than an unknown.** "Is 14.8% uncategorized tolerable?" belongs to the product, and `docs/prd.md` carries it as an open decision; answering yes is what keeps the rules engine from ever existing.
>
> The other half of this phase moved too. The category list is fixed (§12.4's amendment) and the MCC map is built (§12.2's amendment), both ahead of the ordering this section describes, because the recon produced the data they were waiting on. What is left here is the seeding, `setCategory`, `setCounterpartyCategory` and the `COALESCE` query — a smaller phase than this section plans for.

### Phase 4 — Credit cards

`getBills`, `getBillSummary`, `manageClosingDate`. Settle the `operation`-enum question from §14.3 first.

> **Amendment, 2026-07-27 — Phase 4 ships.** The delivered surface is `getBills`, `getBillSummary`, `listClosingDays`, `setClosingDay` and `deleteClosingDay`. The live read-only acceptance record is `docs/research/2026-07-26-phase-4-acceptance.md`. It records both bill figures, their gap, freshness and bounded top counts without storing ids or statement detail.

### Phase 5 — Operations

`manualUpdate` with its hours-long debounce, and `listSources`. Pitfall #7 becomes an explicit error here: empty response → check consent → if revoked or expired, fail loudly instead of reporting "no transactions".

> **Amendment, 2026-07-26 — `manualUpdate` left this phase for Phase 0.** It was here because the debounce looked like it needed persistence; it does not, because Pluggy enforces the interval itself (§11). The poll loop lives in `core/refresh.ts` and `init` is its first caller. What stays here is exposing it as an MCP tool, which is the part that needs §16.4's error split settled, and `listSources`.

> **Amendment, 2026-07-26 — `manualUpdate` did not go anywhere; it is deleted.** The amendment above moved it to Phase 0, and connector 200's refusal then removed it altogether (§14.5). Nothing about it comes back to this phase. **What is left here is `listSources` and pitfall #7**, and the pitfall is now the whole of the phase's value: an empty response has to be checked against consent and fail loudly rather than report "no transactions". §16.4's error split is still owed, by the tools that remain rather than by this one — and the recon adds a constraint to `listSources` itself: `GET /consents?itemId=` returns a consent whose own `itemId` field is a *different* UUID from the one queried, on all three connections, so the consent cannot be joined back to our connection by its id. The only reliable association is "this is what the endpoint returned when asked about that item".

> **Amendment, 2026-07-27 — Phase 5 ships.** `core/consent.ts` holds the verdict as a pure function of a `Consent | null` and the clock — `active`, `revoked`, `expired` or `unknown`, with `revoked` outranking `expired` when both apply and `null` mapping to `unknown` rather than to a guessed `revoked`. `collectAccounts` calls it only when a connection answers with zero accounts, replacing the old guess ("revoked consent is the usual cause") with a real check; a consent lookup that itself fails falls back to the same `no-accounts` result rather than turning a mild diagnostic into a crash. `core/diagnose.ts` is the one function both `listSources` and `doctor` (Phase 7) read: it fans out `getConnection` and `getConsent` per connection, independently, so a broken consent lookup does not take the item status with it and the reverse holds too.
>
> Two inversions worth recording, because they read as contradictions if found separately. `getAccounts` now returns `isError` when zero accounts came back in total *and* at least one connection was unavailable — for any failure kind, not only consent, since restricting it to consent would leave "credentials refused everywhere" reporting a balance of zero. `listSources`, reading the same `core/diagnose.ts`, never does: for it a broken connection *is* the diagnosis the agent came for, and erroring at the moment everything is rotten would hide the very thing the tool exists to surface. One function, two opposite loudness rules, both correct for what calls them.
>
> Untouched, as designed: the consent's own `itemId` field never entered `wire.ts`, and the shape of a *revoked* consent is still unobserved — every test here proves the rule against a hand-written fixture, not against a real revocation Pluggy has sent.

### Phase 6 — Installments

`getInstallments`, last, with real data in hand (§14.2).

### Phase 7 — `doctor` and the README

`doctor` as specified in §14.6. The README is a deliverable of this phase, not an afterthought (§1), and it must state the security posture explicitly (§9).

> **Amendment, 2026-07-27 — Phase 7 ships.** `storage/diagnostics.ts` reads schema versions, per-connection cache coverage and the three categorization table counts off `transaction_sync`, `transactions` and `userdata`, including the two database file paths straight from the open connection via `PRAGMA database_list` rather than threading them through as a separate parameter. An empty database reads as zeroes and `null`, never a throw — `doctor` runs precisely when things are broken, and a diagnostic that cannot survive a fresh install would be worse than useless. `cli/doctor.ts` renders that alongside `core/diagnose.ts`'s per-connection report as four stderr blocks — connections, storage, cache, categorization — plus a summary line, and reuses `describeSync` (now extracted to `cli/sync.ts` so `init` and `doctor` cannot drift apart on what "synced 3h ago" means).
>
> The second inversion of this pair of phases: a stale sync — `status: UPDATED` with nothing in the item payload explaining why it stopped — is a warning line and exits `0`. Nothing distinguishes "not scheduled yet" from "will never sync again" (§11), and failing on a condition neither this project nor the user can diagnose would be worse than reporting it plainly. Only a revoked or expired consent, a connection that could not be read at all, refused credentials, or unreadable storage exit non-zero.
>
> The README is a rewrite, not a patch. It names all nine tools shipped so far by intent rather than by module, describes the four credit-card tools on the parallel branch the same way — capability only, no parameters — so nothing here can drift out of sync with a signature this branch has never run, and states the §9 security posture and the pitfall #8 limit as facts rather than leaving them assumed.

> **Amendment, 2026-07-27 — mutation testing could not be run to completion.** `core/` and `pluggy/` both changed, which is the trigger this section names. Three attempts — default concurrency, `--concurrency 1` against a freshly rebuilt incremental cache, and `--concurrency 2` with `coverageAnalysis: all` in place of `perTest` — each hung during Stryker's dry run, past instrumentation and into "Creating N test runner process(es)", with no mutant ever executed. `npm run typecheck`, `lint`, `deps` and `test` all stayed green throughout (607 tests) under the same Node 24 runtime, so this reads as an environment interaction specific to this machine's Stryker invocation rather than a defect in the code the mutation run would have exercised. Worth a retry in a clean environment before the next `core/`- or `pluggy/`-touching change; §"Code quality process" already says mutation testing never fails the build, and it does not block this one either.

### V2 — Rules

`category_rules` at a new `user_version`, the specificity engine, `addRule` / `listRules` / `deleteRule`, ambiguity detection in `doctor`, and the discoverability design of §12.8.

---

## 16. Prior art: `openfinance-mcp-server`

A Go implementation by the same author, at `../openfinance-mcp-server`, already exposes Pluggy data over MCP. It is a **stateless passthrough**: no cache, no categorization, no migrations, no CLI. `cata-centavo` is a superset, so the useful question is not "what does it do" but "what did it already pay for".

Caveat that governs everything below: **only `internal/provider/sqlite` and `internal/provider/secret` have tests.** The entire Pluggy client and all twelve tool handlers are unverified. Treat its behaviour as *observed practice*, not proven correctness — several findings here are bugs, not patterns.

### 16.1 Adopt

**Domain vocabulary and the description template** — already promoted to §14.0.

**The TTL store, wholesale.** A single KV table (`key`, `value`, `expires_at`), lazy expiry on read, `ttl <= 0` meaning permanent, no sweeper, and a **clock injected as a struct field** — which is what makes its TTL test deterministic without a fake-timer library, and maps directly onto our `Clock` port (§7). Keys namespaced by a `prefix:name` convention. Right shape for our API key and connect tokens.

**Its two best tests, as templates for §9.** One seals a value, reads the raw blob back with a direct query, and asserts the plaintext is *not* present on disk — verifying the property, not that a function was called. The other reopens the same file with a different key and asserts failure. Both are worth copying almost literally.

**SQLite pragmas:** `journal_mode=WAL`, `busy_timeout=5000`, and a max of one open connection, with the comment "*a single local writer avoids SQLITE_BUSY*". We have exactly one writer too.

**The poll-and-wait shape for `manualUpdate`** (§14.5): 2s initial backoff, doubling, capped at 30s, bounded retry count, cancellation checked both at the loop head and inside the sleep. It is the one well-built retry in the repo. **One change:** it treats anything other than `UPDATING`/`UPDATED` as terminal and therefore rejects `PARTIAL_SUCCESS`, which §14.5 requires us to accept.

> **Amendment, 2026-07-26 — adopted in `core/refresh.ts`, with two changes rather than one.** The backoff is verbatim: 2s, doubling, 30s ceiling, 40 attempts, a little over eighteen minutes against a documented five-minute worst case for the login step alone. `PARTIAL_SUCCESS` is accepted, as required.
>
> The second change is the inverse of the first. Rather than widening the "keep going" set to admit `PARTIAL_SUCCESS`, the loop narrows it to `UPDATING` alone and treats everything else as terminal — which is what Pluggy's own polling recipe does. Enumerating the states worth continuing on is the bug: get the enum wrong and an unknown status spins for the full eighteen minutes. Enumerating the states worth *stopping* on cannot fail that way.
>
> Cancellation is the one part not adopted. In-loop checks earn their keep when this is an MCP tool a client can cancel without killing the process; today the only caller is `init`, where Ctrl-C ends the process and the handler's job is just to give the cursor back.

> **Amendment, 2026-07-26 — the loop is deleted, and the finding it was adopted for outlives it.** `core/refresh.ts` went with `manualUpdate` (§14.5), so nothing in this codebase polls anything today, and the backoff shape sits in the "adopt" column waiting for the day something does. The correction is what is worth keeping, because it is about retry loops rather than about item updates: **enumerate the states worth stopping on, never the states worth continuing on.** A wrong "keep going" allowlist spins for eighteen minutes; a wrong "stop" list terminates early and reports. Only one of those failures is visible.

**The liquidated-investment filter, verbatim including all three conditions:** skip when `status == "TOTAL_WITHDRAWAL" && balance == 0 && amount == 0`. Pluggy returns fully-withdrawn positions forever. The three-way `AND` is itself the finding — status alone was evidently not sufficient. Also strip the nested `transactions[]` array a position carries; it is unbounded and will dominate a response.

**The bounded response shape of the current-bill tool:** seven scalars plus exactly five top transactions. It is the only payload in the repo that respects a context window, and it is the model for `getBillSummary`.

**The three response helpers** (`validationError`, `toolError`, `jsonResponse`), extracted *after* the tools were written rather than designed up front. The value is that every handler's happy path and every failure path is one line, so the body holds only domain logic.

### 16.2 Avoid — scars that are bugs

**The response serializer strips `0` and `false`.** A shared `stripEmpty` deletes any zero number, empty string or false boolean before the model sees it. In a financial tool a balance of exactly `0` disappears, and `0` and "not reported" become indistinguishable. **Strip only `null`/`undefined`, never falsy values.** Adopt the idea of one shared serializer; reject this policy.

**It round-trips money through `float64`.** The serializer marshals, unmarshals into an untyped map, and re-marshals — so exact decimals decode into floats and the precision library upstream is defeated at the boundary. **Pick one money representation (integer cents, or strings) and never let a value pass through a JS `number`.**

**These two combined hid a fact from the author.** Its `Transaction.Category` is a non-nullable string, so Pluggy's `null` becomes `""`, and the stripper then removes the field. The repo could never have observed that free-tier `category` comes back null — the evidence was deleted before a human could see it. This is why Phase 0.5 step 5 says to trust the raw HTTP body only.

**`Fatal` is called from inside the provider layer** — seven times, on missing credentials, unreadable config, store failures and auth failure — and the client constructor performs network I/O before any tool is registered. So bad credentials or a Pluggy outage exits the process before the MCP handshake, and the user sees "server failed to start" with the explanation in a log file they don't know exists.

**This is the one place our architecture must consciously diverge.** `doctor` and `init` (§14.6) exist to *report* exactly these conditions, and cannot report a condition that terminates the process. Every credential, config and auth failure is a returned error; client construction is pure and connects on first use.

**The logger falls back to stdout.** If the log file cannot be opened, every log call writes protocol-corrupting text into the JSON-RPC channel — and the handlers log heavily. This is the concrete failure mode behind §4's stderr rule: **the fallback must be stderr, never stdout.** Relatedly, it logs a live 30-minute bearer token into a `0666` file. No secret value is ever an argument to a log call, and the log file gets the same `0600` as everything else.

**The rate limiter is wired to two of nine endpoints.** It exists, it works, and seven call sites simply forgot to invoke it — including the item-status poll, which fans out concurrently across all connections. **Put the limiter inside the single HTTP send function** so a new endpoint cannot forget it. (The limit *value* is disputed — see Phase 0.5 step 4.)

> **Amendment, 2026-07-26 — one send function, now two windows.** `PATCH /items/{id}` is limited to 20/min where everything else gets 360, so a single shared window would let a fan-out of reads spend the update budget. Both windows are claimed inside `transport`, which is the same lesson applied twice: the choke point decides, not the call site.
>
> This section also acquired a scar of our own, in the same family as the serializer above. `classify` built its message from the status code and discarded the response body, so the first real 400 from `PATCH /items/{id}` said "Pluggy returned 400" and named none of the four causes Pluggy documents for that status. The evidence was deleted before a human could see it, again, and it took a live credential to notice. **Every non-2xx body is parsed and its explanation repeated.**

> **Amendment, 2026-07-26 — one send function, one window again.** The second window went out with `manualUpdate` (§14.5): there is no `PATCH /items/` left to limit separately, so the rule reverts to the form this section states, and the lesson loses a qualifier rather than gaining one. The choke point decides, not the call site.
>
> The scar above stays, because it was never about updating an item. Every non-2xx body is parsed and its explanation repeated, and the read path needs that from a 400 or a 410 exactly as much as the refresh needed it: §14.2's 410 carries `ENDPOINT_DEPRECATED` and names the endpoint that replaced it, and a client that threw the status code alone would have reported "Pluggy returned 410" and left a human to find the migration on their own.

**A declared tool parameter that never reaches the wire.** One transaction filter is parsed, validated, logged and assigned to a struct field that the query builder never reads. The tool advertises a filter that does nothing. **Every tool parameter needs a test proving it reaches the request.**

**Two npx-hostile details:** it auto-loads a `.env` from the *current working directory*, which under `npx` is arbitrary; and an earlier commit embedded credentials into the binary at build time, since reverted. No cwd-relative config, no build-time secrets.

### 16.3 The storage split, stated explicitly

Its sealed KV store cannot be extended to hold transactions, and the temptation to generalize one `Store` interface over both is real — the failure would be discovered late and be expensive.

Two independent blockers: values are AES-GCM sealed and therefore **opaque to SQL**, which makes §12.3's "derive the category inside one query" impossible; and a JSON-blob-per-key KV cannot express `WHERE date BETWEEN` or a `COALESCE` join at all. **Two storage abstractions, deliberately: a sealed KV for secrets, and a typed relational cache for data.**

This also explains why the prior art needs no migrations and we do (§10): a single generic KV table is structurally immune to schema change. That immunity does not transfer to a typed `transactions` table.

### 16.4 An unresolved design question it surfaces

Its error helpers return **both** a response object and a non-nil error. In MCP those are different channels: a protocol-level error, whose text the model may never see, versus an `isError` tool result the model can read and act on. Returning both leaves the choice to the SDK.

**Decide per case, and record it.** Anything the model should recover from — revoked consent (§14.5), an unknown `connectionId`, legitimately empty bills (§14.3) — must be readable `isError` content, not a thrown error. Getting this backwards turns our loudest, most carefully designed failure into an opaque transport error.

### 16.5 Evidence for two decisions already taken

A Python script in the repo computes the bill formula outside the binary. Its history explains it: a skill file first taught the *model* to do the arithmetic, then a script was offered "when precision is needed", then it was promoted into a real tool. Neither earlier rung was deleted.

That is direct evidence for §14.2's choice to make `getInstallments` a derived server-side tool rather than a prompt — the author already tried the prompt route and abandoned it. It is also a standing warning: **the moment you find yourself writing instructions telling the model how to combine two tool outputs, that combination belongs in a tool.** Note this is distinct from §12.8's plan, which uses tool *descriptions* to advertise a capability rather than to teach an algorithm.

## Branches not yet walked

Decisions this document names but does not make. Each says what it blocks, so a session picking up the ADR knows whether it can proceed.

- **Cache freshness by range** — how to know whether `[from, to]` is partially cached. `fresh(accountId, from, to)` is still hand-waved, and it is load-bearing for every read path. Blocks phase 1.

  > **Amendment, 2026-07-26 — harder than when it was written.** The 7-day window Phase 1 leans on belongs to regulated Open Finance connectors, and connector 200 reports `isOpenFinance: false`, so the justification does not transfer: neither the lookback window nor the monthly quota table is ours to reason about, because both describe the connections made one level down inside MeuPluggy. We cannot force a refresh (§11), and one of the author's three connections is stalled — `nextAutoSyncAt: null`, `lastUpdatedAt` three days old, `status: UPDATED`, no error and no `statusDetail` to explain it. So freshness cannot be predicted from the connector, cannot be forced from the API, and cannot be inferred from the item's own fields. Whatever `fresh(accountId, from, to)` becomes has to be built on what we already fetched and when, not on a promise about what Pluggy holds. `docs/prd.md` carries this as the first of its blocking decisions.
- ~~**Config format versioning** written by `init`. Blocks phase 0.~~ **Closed 2026-07-25** by removing the config file: configuration is environment-only (§4). Reopens the day a config file returns, and the answer waiting for it is an integer `version` field with a forward migration chain, refusing to guess when the file is newer than the binary.
- **Test fixtures without committing real bank statements** to a public repository (§1 makes the repo public). Blocks phase 0.5, which is where fixtures get captured.
- **`camelCase` or `snake_case`** for tool names (§14.0). Mechanical to apply, expensive to change after the README documents it. Blocks phase 1.
- **The `isError`-content versus protocol-error split** (§16.4), per failure class. Our loudest designed failure — revoked consent — is worthless if it lands in the channel the model cannot read. Blocks phase 1.
- **The aggregate grouping of `getTransactions`** — `sampleIds` and the cap are settled (§14.2), but *what the groups are* (category? merchant? account? month?) is not, and the token budget follows from it. Blocks phase 2.
- ~~**`manageClosingDate` as one tool with an `operation` enum, versus three verbs** (§14.3). Blocks phase 4.~~ **Closed 2026-07-27:** `listClosingDays`, `setClosingDay` and `deleteClosingDay`.

Two more are empirical rather than decisions, and Phase 0.5 exists to answer them: transaction id stability across re-sync (which §12's whole override design rests on) and whether Connector 200 is a regulated or Direct connector (which three separate decisions branch on blindly).

> **Amendment, 2026-07-26 — one of the two is answered, and a different one takes its place.** Connector 200 is neither regulated nor Direct: it is Pluggy's own aggregator, and the three decisions that branched on it now branch on `isOpenFinance: false` (§15 Phase 0.5's amendment). Transaction id stability is still open and now needs a manual refresh inside meu.pluggy.ai to answer at all, since `PATCH /items/{id}` is refused. Joining it as the second open empirical question: whether the general rate limit is 360 per minute or per hour, which the recon could not settle because it never came close to either bound.

/**
 * The six branches as six columns, plus the durable leaf.
 *
 * `c_leaf` is the finest category we still know for the row: what Pluggy sends
 * today, and what the snapshot remembers once it stops sending anything. It is
 * not a seventh branch — it is not rolled up and never competes for the derived
 * category. It exists because the self-transfer exclusion in `core/aggregate.ts`
 * distinguishes a credit card payment from an ordinary transfer, and only the
 * leaf carries that distinction. Reading `transactions.category_id` directly
 * there would let every card bill payment re-enter `spent` the day the plan
 * drops to free.
 *
 * Resolution happens in `core/category-source.ts`, driven by the same array
 * that builds this.
 *
 * There is deliberately no `CREATE VIEW`. A view living in the droppable file
 * and referencing `userdata.` would couple `cache.db`'s schema to a schema name
 * that has to be attached already — including during the migration run at
 * startup, before any attach has happened.
